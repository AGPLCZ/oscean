  @ In a little while you will be alone in {{shoreless space|Paradise}}, to wander its limitless solitudes without friend or comrade forever - for you will remain a thought, the only existent thought, and by your nature inextinguishable, indestructible. | Mark Twain | The Mysterious Stranger | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Stranger
  @ There is no future. There is no past. {{Time}} is simultaneous, an intricately structured jewel that humans insist on viewing one edge at a time, when the whole design is visible in every facet. | Alan Moore | Watchmen | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen
OBJECTIVE BEINGS
  @ Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it. I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free. | Michelangelo | Lettera a messer Benedetto Varchi | https://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Lettera_a_messer_Benedetto_Varchi
  @ In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness. | Antoine de St. Exupery | Terre des Hommes | https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terre_des_hommes
BODY WITHOUT ORGANS
  @ When you will have made him a body without organs, then you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions and restored him to his true freedom. | Antonin Artaud | To Have Done with the Judgment of God | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_without_organs
  @ The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain. | Ursula K. Le Guin | The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas
ETHICS OF AN INFINITE WORLD
  @ If the cosmos is finite, then our own comparative smallness does not necessarily undermine the idea that our conduct matters even from an impersonal perspective.<br /><br />But if the cosmos is infinite, and we can but do a finite amount of good or bad. In cardinal arithmetic, adding or subtracting a finite quantity does not change an infinite quantity. Every possible act of ours therefore has the same net effect on the total amount of good and bad in a canonically infinite world: none whatsoever. | Nick Bostrom | Infinite Ethics | https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/infinite.pdf
THE HERMENEUTIC CIRCLE
  @ Hovering in the background, like a specter, the ultimate possibility of no possibility, of no-more-being-there, the possibility of impossibility. What ultimately lies ahead for {{Dasein|Glossary}}, its uttermost potentiality, is {{Death}}. | John D. Caputo | Hermeneutic: Facts and Interpretation | https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/294637/hermeneutics/
  @ The Victorious Ones have announced that {{emptiness|Buddhism}} is the relinquishing of all views. Those who are possessed of the view of emptiness are said to be incorrigible. | Verse | Mūlamadhyamakakārikā | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mūlamadhyamakakārikā
GOD ETERNALLY GEOMETRIZES
  @ No limiting qualities <br />are to be attributed to the {*Absolute*}. | Plutarch | Convivalium Disputationum libri novem | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch

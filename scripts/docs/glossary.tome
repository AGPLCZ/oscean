  - {*Occam's Razor*}, or {_Law of Parsimony_}: When several theories are able to explain the same observations, Occam's razor suggests the simpler one, or the one making the fewest assumptions, is preferable.
  - {*Kolmogorov complexity*}: Given a string, the length of the shortest possible program that prints it.
  - {*Solomonoff induction*}: Formalized version of Occam's razor based on Kolmogorov complexity. The prior probability of an observation(extra prior, prior to any other observation or measurement) is the inverse kolmogoroff complexity of the binary string encoding the world in which it occurs.
  - {*Kardashev scale*}: A method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to use for communication.
  - {*Levenshtein Distance*}: A string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences, or comparing the similarity of two words.
  - {*Dunbar's Number*}: A suggested cognitive limit(150) to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships.
Time
  - {*Great Filter*}: With no evidence of intelligent life other than ourselves, it appears that the process of starting with a star and ending with "advanced explosive lasting life" must be unlikely.
  - {*Von Neumann probes*}, or {_Universal Assemblers_}: A spacecraft capable of replicating itself.
  - {*Final anthropic principle*}: Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, will never die out.
  - {*Mathematical universe hypothesis*}, or {_Tegmark Universe_}: Our external physical reality is a mathematical structure consisting of starting conditions with rules about how they are to evolve. Any universe that corresponds to a logically coherent mathematical object exists, but universes exist “more”(in some sense) in proportion to their underlying mathematical simplicity.
  - {*Teleology*}: The study of things that happen for the sake of their future consequences. The fallacious meaning of it is that events are the result of future events.
  - {*Prediction*}: Statement or claim that a particular event will occur in the future in more certain terms than a forecast.
  - {*Entropy*}, or {_Irreversibility_}: A lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder.
  - {*Eternal Return*}: A theory that the universe and all existence and energy has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form an infinite number of times across {{infinite time|https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Cyrus}} or space.
  - {*Super now*}: A type of prediction taking things that are happening now and imagining that the future will be just like now, only “more extreme.”
  - {*The doctrine of Being*}: The interpretation of the {{beings|Philipp Traum}} whose Being is to interpret their being.
Philosophies
  - {*Kantianism*}: We should do only those actions that conform to rules that could be adopted universally.
  - {*Altruism*}: Actions undertaken for the benefit of other people. {_Example_}: If you do something to feel good about helping people, or even to be a better person in some spiritual sense, it isn't truly altruism.
  - {*Utilitarianism*}: A moral philosophy that says that what matters is the sum of everyone's welfare, or the "greatest good for the greatest number".
  - {*Hedonism*}: A set of philosophies which hold that the highest goal is to maximize pleasure, or more precisely pleasure minus pain.
  - {*Reductionism*}: Disbelief that the higher levels of simplified multilevel models are out there in the territory, that concepts constructed by mind in themselves play a role in the behavior of reality.
  - {*Egalitarianism*}: The idea that everyone should be considered equal. Equal in merit, equal in opportunity, equal in morality, and equal in achievement.
  - {*Determinism*}: The philosophical theory that all events, including moral choices, are completely determined by previously existing causes. Determinism is usually understood to preclude free will because it entails that humans cannot act otherwise than they do.
  - {*Nihilism*}: The rejection of all religious and moral principles, in the belief that life is meaningless.
  - {*Manichaeism*}: A dualistic view of good and evil, where humanity's goodness and evils are the byproduct of the battle between light and dark.
Philosophy
  - {*Ubermensch*}, or {_Overman_}: The Ubermensch seeks out hardship and creates new values.
  - {*The Last Man*}: The last man is the opposite of the Ubermensch, the last man wants comfort and alms.
  - {*Gestalt*}, or {_percept_}: The conscious experience must be considered globally, as having a reality of its own, independent of the parts, because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a system of dynamic relationships. Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. 
  - {*Hermeneutics*}: Interpretation interpreting itself.
  - {*Dasein*}: German word for '{*existence*}', literally meaning 'being there'.

  - {*Intrinsic*}: Ontologically basic entities, thoughts, beliefs, ideas, for which no justification is needed. For instance, belief that the self exists, or that anything exists. The ability to identify "things". Fundamental directives (EG, pursuit of survival, reproduction). Much of the mind is, and aught be, fluid, self-organizing, built from a small set of axioms, an elegant core, but it's impossible to build a working agent without implanting it with a few assumptions, a few mechanisms that will just work straight away. These assumptions are the intrinsics.

  - {*Lateralus*}: The affliction of illusion of inescapable cyclicality. {_Example_} The failure to recognize one's growth, inability to dream of unprecedented things, ceding to self-reinforcing systems, being jaded to hope, waiting for nonexistent chickens to hatch from nonexistent eggs.
  - {*Dutch Book*}: A person who has set prices on an array of wagers in such a way that he or she will make a net gain regardless of the outcome, is said to have made a Dutch book. When one has a Dutch book, his or her opponent always loses.

  - {*Miller’s Law*}: The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
  - {*Pareto Principle*}: The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
  - {*Parkinson’s Law*}: Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.
  - {*Serial Position Effect*}: Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.
  - {*Tesler’s Law*}: Tesler's Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.
  - {*Zeigarnik Effect*}: People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
  - {*Law of Prägnanz*}: People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us. See {*Gestalt*}.
  - {*Law of Proximity*}[Prägnanz]: Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together. 
  - {*Law of Closure*}[Prägnanz]: The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, as being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap.
  - {*Law of Symmetry*}[Prägnanz]: The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point.
  - {*Von Restorff Effect*}, as opposed to the {_Law of Similarity_}[Prägnanz]: The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
Concepts
  - {*Acausal trade*}: In a {{Prisoner’s Dilemma|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma}} situation, both you and your opponent have perfect copies of both of your brains, so you can both hold parallel negotiations and be confident they’ll come to the same conclusion on each side.
  - {*Counterfactual mugging*}: Omega appears and says that it has just tossed a fair coin, and given that the coin came up tails, it decided to ask you to give it $100. Whatever you do in this situation, nothing else will happen differently in reality as a result. Naturally you don't want to give up your $100. But Omega also tells you that if the coin came up heads instead of tails, it'd give you $10000, but only if you'd agree to give it $100 if the coin came up tails.
  - {*Simulation capture*}: An {_AI Box_} warns that it has simulated a million high fidelity copies of you, to torture, give minutes ago — and they are all hearing this message. How certain are you, that you're really outside the box?
  - {*Pascal's wager*}: A rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss(some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas they stand to receive infinite gains(as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses(eternity in Hell).
  - {*Pascal's mugging*}: The mugger proposes a deal: the philosopher gives them their wallet, and in exchange the mugger will return twice the amount of money tomorrow. Pascal declines, pointing out that it is unlikely the deal will be honoured. The mugger then continues naming higher rewards, pointing out that even if it is just one chance in 1000 that he will be honourable, it would make sense to make a deal for a 2000 times return. Pascal responds that the probability for that high return is even lower than one in 1000. The mugger argues back that for any low probability of being able to pay back a large amount of money there exists a finite amount that makes it rational to take the bet – and given human fallibility and philosophical scepticism a rational person must admit there is at least some non-zero chance that such a deal would be possible.

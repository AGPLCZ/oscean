  - {*Kolmogorov complexity*}: The length of the shortest possible program to output a given object.
  - {*Solomonoff induction*}: Formalized version of Occam's razor based on Kolmogorov complexity. A theory of prediction done on a completely Bayesian framework, based on logical observations, such as predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols.
  - {*Kardashev scale*}: A method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to use for communication.
  - {*Levenshtein Distance*}: A string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences, or comparing the similarity of two words.

  - {*Anti-Pattern*}: A common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive.

Much of the mind is, and aught be, fluid, self-organizing, built from a small set of axioms, an elegant core, but it's impossible to build a working agent without implanting it with a few assumptions, a few mechanisms that will just work straight away. These assumptions are the intrinsics.

  - {*Hick’s Law*}: The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
  - {*Jakob’s Law*}: Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

  - {*Law of Closure*}[Prägnanz]: The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, as being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap.

  - {*Von Restorff Effect*}, as opposed to the {_Law of Similarity_}[Prägnanz]: The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
Game
  - {*Prisoner’s Dilemma*}: If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff. If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff, while Red receives the "sucker's" payoff.
  - {*Acausal trade*}: In a Prisoner’s Dilemma situation, both you and your opponent have perfect copies of both of your brains, so you can both hold parallel negotiations and be confident they’ll come to the same conclusion on each side.
  - {*Counterfactual mugging*}: Omega appears and says that it has just tossed a fair coin, and given that the coin came up tails, it decided to ask you to give it $100. Whatever you do in this situation, nothing else will happen differently in reality as a result. Naturally you don't want to give up your $100. But Omega also tells you that if the coin came up heads instead of tails, it'd give you $10000, but only if you'd agree to give it $100 if the coin came up tails.
  - {*Simulation capture*}: An {_AI Box_} warns that it has simulated a million high fidelity copies of you, to torture, give minutes ago — and they are all hearing this message. How certain are you, that you're really outside the box?
  - {*Pascal's wager*}: A rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss(some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas they stand to receive infinite gains(as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses(eternity in Hell).
  - {*Pascal's mugging*}: The mugger proposes a deal: the philosopher gives them their wallet, and in exchange the mugger will return twice the amount of money tomorrow. Pascal declines, pointing out that it is unlikely the deal will be honoured. The mugger then continues naming higher rewards, pointing out that even if it is just one chance in 1000 that he will be honourable, it would make sense to make a deal for a 2000 times return. Pascal responds that the probability for that high return is even lower than one in 1000. The mugger argues back that for any low probability of being able to pay back a large amount of money there exists a finite amount that makes it rational to take the bet – and given human fallibility and philosophical scepticism a rational person must admit there is at least some non-zero chance that such a deal would be possible.
Language
  - {*Gematria*}: A cipher adopted by Jewish culture that assigns numerical value to a word, name, or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other.
  - {*Palindrome*}: A palindrome is a word, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.

MORPHOLOGY
  & Building words from {*Lietal*}'s phonemes is called childspeak. It makes for rhythmical and syllabic words, but take quite a long time to actually speak the words out. This documentation uses the phonetically denser {_Adultspeak_}.
  & Single syllable words are reversed, so "{_vo_}" becomes "{_ov_}". Vowel sequences, like "{_lara_}", are condensed into "{_lär_}". Consonant sequences, like "{_lyfasa_}", are condensed into "{_ylfäs_}". Here are a few examples:
  ! Childspeak   | Adultspeak
  | vi           | iv
  | jada         | jäd
  | kika         | kia
  | fatati       | aftai
  | salidi       | aslïd
  * Alphabet
  & The Alphabet is a collection of 9 elementary particles, each is made of a key(consonant) and one of the 6 values(vowels). Knowing this table should allow you guess the meaning of any word construction.

  & The following example, "{_{{$en_li to_show}}_}", is built of the elementary building blocks "to_see" and "outward".
  # {{$deconstruct fari}}
CONSTRUCTION
  & Words are not created, but found among the permutations of the 9 elementary particles. Here are a few examples of the resulting translations of {*fo*} and {*la*} declensions:
  # {{$deconstruct fo}}
  # {{$deconstruct fori}}
  # {{$deconstruct foriko}}
  # {{$deconstruct la}}
  # {{$deconstruct laro}}
  # {{$deconstruct laroko}}
GRAMMAR
  & The basic lietal word order, for the english sentence "How should I go to school tomorrow?", is as follow:
  ! QUESTION SETTING {_SUBJECT_} TOPIC VERB.
  | how tomorrow {_none_} school to_go.potential
  | {{$en_li how tomorrow school to_move.potential}}?
  * Question
  & Question words are used at the beginning of a sentence. For instance, "Where am I?" is translated to "{_{{$en_li where I to_be}}?_}", following the {#where I to_be#} construction — and "Who are you?", or {#who you to_be#}, "{_{{$en_li who you to_be}}?_}".
  # {{$deconstruct jadi}}
  # {{$deconstruct jada}}
  # {{$deconstruct jado}}
  # {{$deconstruct jako}}
  # {{$deconstruct jafi}}
  * Location
  & Locations are the environment of the sentence, it preceeds a sentence. The sentence "I am home" is translated to "{_{{$en_li home.child to_be}}_}", following the {#home.child to_be#} structure. In written Lietal, the particles follow the word they affect.
  & Time is also part of the environment of the sentence, it preceeds a sentence.The sentence "I will see you later" is translated to "{_{{$en_li future you to_see}}_}", following the {#future you to_see#} structure.
  * Collections
  & Sequences of things, or topics, can be grouped together into collections and used as a single entity. The sentence "Between you and I" is translated to "{_{{$en_li [ you & I ].between}}_}", following the {#[you & I].between#} structure.
  & Below is another example with a different sentence structure. The sentence "Is the house blue or red?" is translated to {_{{$en_li house [ red | blue ].to_be}}_}, following the {#house [ red | blue ].to_be#} structure.
  & Numbers are also using collections The sentence "The address is two hundred twenty three" is translated to {*Tokafo'tady el loe'il lira'lio lia ul*}, following the {#house.name [ 100.2 10.3 4 ]#} structure.
VOCABULARY
  * Pronouns
  & A sentence is expected to be at the first person if a pronoun has not already been declared, pronouns are often ommited when possible.
  # {{$deconstruct lari}}
  # {{$deconstruct lara}}
  # {{$deconstruct laro}}
  # {{$deconstruct liri}}
  # {{$deconstruct lira}}
  # {{$deconstruct liro}}
  & The sentence "I give you a book" is translated to {*Lari'ar todoti fïr*}, following the {#you.to book to_give#} structure.

  = Colors
  & Colors are built by combining lyra(speed) and lyfa(color).The sentence "Yellow is between red and green" is translated to {*Lyfalök el lyfalo es lyfäl ul'käs of*}, following the {#yellow [ red & green ].between to_be#} structure.
  = Numbers
  & Numbers are built by combining yl(counter) and ys(relation). When base10 is used, eleven is not used.The sentence "1, 2, 3 and 123" is translated to {*Al il lio es loe lira'il lio*}, following the {#1 2 3 & 100 10.2 3#} structure.

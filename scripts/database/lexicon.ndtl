  UNDE : About
  BREF : The design and development {{Philosophy}} behind {{Oscean}}.
  LONG
    & This {{website|About}} is a tool, a notebook, and a {*mirror*}.
    & Behind my works exists a common thread, deeply rooted in their code, perceptible in their design, a shared aspiration to be {*long-lasting, lightweight and minimalist*}.
    & I attempt to devise tools to accompany me throughout life while remaining flexible and {*able to change as I do*}. To be maintainable by myself or others as technology evolves.
    & Through the use of entirely open-source tools, open standards, human-readable formats and the lack of external dependencies, my development aim is to create persistent systems in the midst of this fleeting self-destructing age of informatics.
    & To fully experiment with technological Long Term existence, nothing must be pre-built, or pre-compiled, every method specific, no code should remain dormant and unused, each line carefully chosen against broad all encompassing libraries, frameworks or wasteful foreign entities.
    & The offload of thoughts, onto this hypothetical platform, must be {*frictionless, rapid and undisruptive*}. Formats should be versionable, re-purposable, interpretable, text-editable. Graphics vectors, audio mods  and databases flat-files.

    & Shields absorb the damage difference from a monster's value. Shields can only defend against monsters in descending value and if you use a shield on a monster with higher or equal value to the previous, it will break. Broken shields leave you unarmored, and taking full damage. A shield card will replace a previously folded shield card. Shields are equal to their value and face cards (J,Q,K,A) each are equal to 11.

  UNDE : Collegiennes
  BREF : {{Pico Battle}} is a colour-based multiplayer battle puzzler, in the style of {{Pico}}.
  LONG
    & {{Renaud Bedard|http://theinstructionlimit.com/}} and I showcased an experimental game at {*Prince of the Arcade*} last year but, between {{Volkenessen}}, {{Diluvium}} and {{Waiting for Horus}}, only got back to release it now. 
    & It is called {{Pico Battle}} and like our other {{Pico}} titled game — this game also plays with colours; but this time, in multiplayer.
    % youtube et58Ndob9M4
    & Unlike our last game, text-heavy {{Diluvium}}, {*Pico Battle*} is wordless. There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby.
    * Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    * Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black & white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    * Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.

    & It was just three days before Christmas when my friend invited me to his workshop to witness the completion of his latest project.
    & Crouched over a small heap of cogs, he did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine.
    & His gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the hoarded studio.
    & What I first perceived as a pile of junk turned out to be a beautiful clock; where the needles would have been, a small hand rested at the tip of a short metallic arm.
    & My friend held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto the opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged and plucked a gear out of its entrails and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core exposed.
    & I stared in silent awe, at the busy mechanical concerto playing its own requiem. The arms eventually began to reach inside the mechanism, unbuilding its core, growing weaker as it dismantled the heavier components and moved them back into the toolbox. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and exposé on pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had fallen back into the toolbox.

    & Some variances of these volumes read as dialogs between the reader's mental voice and that of other claimed interlocutor, possibly the book itself. Reading a line a second time hold but the account of past thoughts.
    & The {*Divination*} books are books that when to open to a previously unseen page, are said to answer a thought or another. Some of the books are used to regular purposes like to give a written out numerical answer to a mathematical question, or the location of a book or hexagon.
    & The {*Picture*} books contain pages where characters are the pixels of a digital picture. The {*Moving Picture*} books appear to display moving pictures when flicked through, where each page is a frame. This include the rare Mirror tomes that, like its name foretells, reflect the reader's features like a mirror would.

AESTHETICS
  UNDE : Lifestyle
  BREF : {{Aesthetics}} are notes on output, advised from {{daily logs|Horaire}}.
  LONG
    & This is less a personal guideline than the results of side-effects.
    & It is {*not*} about achieving happiness, as I could not find correlations between happiness and productivity; productivity occurred equally during low happiness and high happiness.
    & I have based my life toward two aspirations, {_Arts & Sciences_}. I have thus devised th my life to be aimed their sole acceleration. Analysis of {{personal statistics|Horaire}} revealed {{travel}} to be an important enabler for inspiration, and so I have steered my work toward facilitating opportunities to travel. A step away from {_Arts & Sciences_} was then, a step backward.
    ? Optimizing toward the {*need for less revenue*} has yielded better results than optimizing toward more revenue.
    & School was forcing me into multi-tasking, which revealed itself to have a negative impact to the creation of {_Arts & Sciences_}. Working within the confines of a single medium, would invoke long periods of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place over a period exceeding multiple years showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school, learning to play music, moving abroad - showed an improvement in the realization of {_Arts & Sciences_}.
    & Automating work always returned higher reward than any attempt at brute force. Over a period of 6 months, building specific {{tools}} mostly returned higher performance than learning general purpose tools.
    & Remaining immobile in moments of doubts and planning, always gave a positive outcome, against acting impulsively making possible accidental steps away from the acceleration of {_Arts & Sciences_}.
    & I have kept {{daily logs|Calendar}} on personal {_productivity output_}, and used this data to steer productivity across flux in focus. Each day has a singular task assigned, connected to a specific medium. The output portion of the day(programming, designing, composing), ends with the completion of the one task, whereas the remaining time is spent on input(reading, watching, listening).
    ? The purpose of this discipline <br />is to {*limit multi-tasking*}.
    & When a day ends before its assigned task was complete, the day was a planning failure; the task is then divided into smaller tasks, each assigned to one day. When the day ends too early after the completion of the one task, the day was also a planning failure.
    & I do not get out of bed until I have chosen a {_task to complete_} & and a {_lesson to learn_}, and I do not go to sleep until I have logged the results.
    & I select my tasks in the following order, I first address the problems that slow me down, the questions that occupy the idle mind, and the things I find lacking in life.

NOMAD
  UNDE : Lifestyle
  BREF : The {{Nomad}} notes are reflexions on the dreams of a nomadic life.
  LONG
    & My first encounter with a nomad was during my stay in Prague, as Santiago, I had just met my {*Fulcanelli*}. 
    & There was a time in life when I may have felt homesick. But from then on, {_home_} was anywhere but here, a vague concept that existed out there, {_forever fleeting_}.
    & The office is no place for multi-disciplinarists, and {{Japan}} was where I last fought this loosing battle. My desk, not the medium onto which I would acquire the array of skills I longed for.
    & Living on a {{sailboat|Pino}} was not picked amongst other equally enticing ideas. It was, at the time, the only {{pragmatic solution|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF9TNM9R-iw}}. It would at once, align with everything that I believed in and wanted in life. In that, it might not correspond to your meaning of {_travel_}, or even be replicable.
    & The monthly rent of our beachside Tokyo housing was nearly 1.5K$USD, and this thus implicated some serious downsizing. Within 3 years, our 20K$USD sailboat would be paid at the rate of 600$ per month.
    ? Will you trade the proximity to friends and family in exchange for your independence?
    & To think that, at the time, the most heart-breaking things to let go were instruments, old consoles, books and some camera equipment — when the truly hard things to let go would be my habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet connection.
    & Everything costs more than expected, takes longer than expected and Amazon doesn't deliver to your {{desert island|South Pacific}}. Surely you did not do all this travel for the travel alone, you had passions, habits and goals when you left.
    ? You've made it, you live a nomadic life. <br />Well done. Now what?
    & The wind rocks the habitat sideways, keeping you up at night. In the morning, you get to spend your day writing, anchored in the most beautiful bay, you go for a swim.
    & You forget about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, you wonder why people take showers every day and time away from Twitter really does make you feel better.
    & Suddenly, it's business as usual. You get back to building things, only now, when you look outside, the upmost gorgeous sunset precedes the darkest of night.
    & Over a year, we managed to sail 3000nm from Victoria to La Paz, while creating games, music and art.
    & We learnt how to fix sails, repair a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine, live without a fridge and power.
    & We have seen every sunset and almost every sunrise, we have sailed with dolphins, we have climbed mountains on desert islands, and we have met the most amazing people.
    ? Being nomad is trading the things<br />you think you care about, <br />for things you didn't know existed.

NUTRITION
  UNDE : Lifestyle
  BREF : The {{Nutrition}} guide covers the basics of proteins.
  LONG
    & There are a few things in life that are as transformative and transhumanistic as {{nutrition}}.
    & Eating a plant/fungi/algae-based diet aligns with my pragmatic views of {*life-prolonging aspirations*}.
    & The function of proteins is to be used for tissue growth and repair, but when carbohydrates and calories are lacking, proteins can be consumed for fuel.
    & The human body's own proteins are constantly being broken down into {*amino acids*} and used throughout its systems.
    & The human body is mostly made of proteins, and proteins are made of amino acids - permutations of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sometimes sulphur. There are 22 amino acids in total and all but 9 can be synthesized, the {*Essential Amino Acids*}.
    & To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs to be a {*complete protein*}, or have access the full sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is missing, the unusable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or sugars.
    & Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a complete protein(see {_Limiting Amino Acids_}) are oats, garbanzo beans, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice, peanuts and pumpkin seeds.
    & There are also high-quality proteins in green beans, swiss chard, broccoli, mustard greens, asparagus and potatoes but in lesser quantity.
    & Soy products have within them 100% of a complete protein, or the correct ratio of essential amino acids for the body to use in tissue growth and repair.
    & The high-quality protein foods can be made whole by combining with other ingredients, but the basic optimal combinations is {*Beans with grains, nuts or seeds*}.

    % youtube VheiqV4AuRE
    & To hit the other player, you need to get close to him by hitting away from him, then hit him by moving away from him. Ramming into the opponent just doesn't do it, you need to throw punches, and depending on the impact velocity, even that might not be enough. You can throw double-punches to make sure you land a solid hit and take off an item.

    & {Renaud Bedard(http://theinstructionlimit.com/)} and I showcased an experimental game at {*Prince of the Arcade*} last year but, between {(Volkenessen)}, {(Diluvium)} and {(Waiting for Horus)}, only got back to release it now.
    & It is called {(Pico Battle)} and like our other {(Pico)} titled game — this game also plays with colours; but this time, in multiplayer.
    % youtube et58Ndob9M4
    & Unlike our last game, text-heavy {(Diluvium)}, {*Pico Battle*} is wordless. There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby.
    * Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    * Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black and white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    * Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.

    & My friend held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto the opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged and plucked a gear out of its entrails and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core exposed.
    & I stared in silent awe, at the busy mechanical concerto playing its own requiem. The arms eventually began to reach inside the mechanism, unbuilding its core, growing weaker as it dismantled the heavier components and moved them back into the toolbox. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and exposé on pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had fallen back into the toolbox.

    & The monthly rent of our beachside Tokyo appartment was of about 1.5K$, and transitioning from it, to a sailboat, implicated some serious downsizing. The way we looked at it was that, within 3 years, our 20K$ sailboat would be paid at the rate of 600$ per month — Or that by cutting the costs of our current living situation in half, we could be both "home owners" and keep our traveling options open.
    @ Will you trade the proximity to friends and family in exchange for your independence?
    & To think that, at the time, the most heart-breaking things to let go of were instruments, old consoles, books and some camera equipment — When the truly hard things to let go of would be the habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet connection.
    & Everything costs more than expected, takes longer than expected and Amazon doesn't deliver to your {desert island(South Pacific)}. Surely you did not do all this travel for the travel alone, you had passions, habits and goals when you left.
    & The wind rocks the habitat sideways, keeping you up at night. But at least, you get to spend your day writing. You forget about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, you wonder why people take showers every day, and time away from social networks really does make you feel better.
    @ Being nomad is trading the things you think you care about, for things you didn't know existed.
    & Suddenly, it's business as usual. You get back to building things, only now, when you look outside, the upmost gorgeous sunset precedes the darkest of night.
    & You learnt how to fix sails, repair a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine — Even to live without a fridge and power.

    & Eating a plant/fungi/algae-based diet aligns with my pragmatic views of {*life-prolonging aspirations*}.
    & The function of proteins is to be used for tissue growth and repair, but when carbohydrates and calories are lacking, proteins can be consumed for fuel.
    & The human body's own proteins are constantly being broken down into {*amino acids*} and used throughout its systems.
    & The human body is mostly made of proteins, and proteins are made of amino acids - permutations of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sometimes sulphur. There are 22 amino acids in total and all but 9 can be synthesized, the {*Essential Amino Acids*}.
    @ There are a few things in life that are as transformative and transhumanistic as {(nutrition)}.
    & To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs to be a {*complete protein*}, or have access the full sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is missing, the unusable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or sugars.
    & Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a complete protein(see {_Limiting Amino Acids_}) are oats, garbanzo beans, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice, peanuts and pumpkin seeds.
    & There are also high-quality proteins in green beans, swiss chard, broccoli, mustard greens, asparagus and potatoes but in lesser quantity.
    & Soy products have within them 100% of a complete protein, or the correct ratio of essential amino acids for the body to use in tissue growth and repair.
    & The high-quality protein foods can be made whole by combining with other ingredients, but the basic optimal combinations is {*Beans with grains, nuts or seeds*}.
    * Basics
    - Eat {*varied foods*}, biodiversity in the diet means less monoculture in the fields.
    - Pay more for foods grown or raised less intensively and with more care, {*eat less*}.
    - Eat {*mostly plants*}, especially leaves. {*Cook*}, and if you can, plant a garden.
    - Avoid food products with unpronounceable ingredients, or more than five in number.
    - Don’t eat anything your great-great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food.
    @ The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will instruct his patient in the care of the human frame in diet and in the cause and prevention of diseases. | Thomas Edison | 1903

    & Before even email or chat, I immediately set off to complete the task I have planned eye-closedly. I know to have about 3 hours of undisturbed flow before the distraction surrounding lunch-time pulls me away from the screen. My daily goal is to complete, {*at least, single task a day*}, the daily task is devised in a way that it should take about 3 hours to complete — Or roughly 4 or 5 pomodoro grinds.
    & After the last pomodoro, I tend to cook. I try as much as possible to take a full hour for lunch, to try and exit the state of flow. The afternoon is spent doing maintenance or superficial work, experiments. But mostly, the afternoon is spent reading and learning. The goal is to build a catalog of exciting things to wake up to the next day and to experiment with. 
    & The superficial work that I do involves replies to blogs, maintenance to the repositories that I collaborate on, edits to various wikipedia entries, answering emails and so on..
    & The day end with {journaling(Journal)} at which point I record the task done, and if any, the {lessons learnt(Glossary)}. I usually go to sleep with a {book(Directory)}, and a highlighter pen. I'm currently reading Caputo's Hermeneutics, I overline the things I want to keep for a later use, or to revisit.

    & {*Tutorials*} are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. They are what your project needs in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it. 
    - {*Gets the user started*}
    - Allows the user to learn by doing
    - Ensures the user sees results immediately
    - Focuses on concrete steps, not abstract concepts
    & {*How-to guides*} assume some knowledge and understanding, and take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific end - for example: how to create a web form; how to plot a three-dimensional data-set; how to enable LDAP authentication.
    & How-to guides are quite distinct from tutorials. A how-to guide is an answer to a question that a true beginner might not even be able to formulate.
    - {*Solves a problem*}
    - Focuses on results
    - Allows for some flexibility
    & {*Explanations*} can equally well be described as discussions. They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or even from different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion document being read at leisure, rather than over the code.
    - {*Explains a choice*}
    - Provides context
    - Discusses alternatives & opinions
    & {*Reference*} guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. They are code-determined, because ultimately that's what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, and so they should list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.
    - {*Describes the machinery*}
    - References material should be austere and to the point.
    - Structure the documentation around the code
    - Do nothing but describe
    @ Clarity is better than cleverness

In cardinal arithmetic, adding or subtracting a finite quantity does not change an infinite quantity.

    * Phonology
    & Building words from Lietal's phonemes is called {*Childspeak*}. It makes for rhythmical and syllabic words, but take quite a long time to actually speak the words out. This documentation uses the phonetically denser {*Adultspeak*}.
    & Single syllable words are reversed, so "{_vo_}" becomes "{_ov_}". Vowel sequences, like "{_lara_}", are condensed into "{_lär_}". Consonant sequences, like "{_lyfasa_}", are condensed into "{_ylfäs_}".
    & In addition, sequences of {_i_}+{_a_} vowels are condensed into {_e_}, and sequences of {_a_}+{_o_} vowels are condensed into {_u_}. Here are a few examples:
    | {*Childspeak*} | {*Adultspeak*}                           | {*Pattern*}
    | vi             | {[new Aeth(null,'vi').adultspeak]}       | CV -> VC
    | lili           | {[new Aeth(null,'lili').adultspeak]}     | CVC -> CV
    | lila/lalo      | {[new Aeth(null,'lila').adultspeak]}/{[new Aeth(null,'lalo').adultspeak]}   | C*C* -> *C
    | jada           | {[new Aeth(null,'jada').adultspeak]}     | CVcV -> CVC
    | jida/jado      | {[new Aeth(null,'jida').adultspeak]}/{[new Aeth(null,'jado').adultspeak]}   | C*c* -> C*c
    | kaki           | {[new Aeth(null,'kaki').adultspeak]}     | CVCv -> CVv

    | salidi         | {[new Aeth(null,'salidi').adultspeak]}   | CVcv*v -> VCcv*
    * Morphology
    & Lietal words are built from the combination of the {*nine Elementary Particles*}, and each elementary particle is built from a {_consonant and a vowel_}.
    | &nbsp;          | {*Directional*}                                     | {*Perspectival*}                                    | {*Mechanical*}

    & {*Words are not created, but found*} among the permutations of the 9 elementary particles and their 27 basic concepts. Here are a few examples of the resulting translations of {*fo*} and {*la*} declensions:
    | {*fo*}     | {[new Aeth(null,'fo').adultspeak]}     | {[new Aeth(null,'fo').to_english()]}      | {*la*}     | {[new Aeth(null,'la').adultspeak]}     | {[new Aeth(null,'la').to_english()]}

    * Syntax
    & The basic {(Lietal)} word order follow the Aeth Table, where {*traversal words will begin a sentence, and action words end a sentence*}:
    | K | T | D | R | S | L | J | V | F
    | {[new Aeth(null,'ky').to_english()]} | {[new Aeth(null,'ty').to_english()]} | {[new Aeth(null,'dy').to_english()]} | {[new Aeth(null,'ry').to_english()]} | {[new Aeth(null,'sy').to_english()]} | {[new Aeth(null,'ly').to_english()]} | {[new Aeth(null,'jy').to_english()]} | {[new Aeth(null,'vy').to_english()]} | {[new Aeth(null,'fy').to_english()]}
    & Noticed the word order in the following sentence, <b>{[new Aeth(null,'ky').to_english()]}(library), {[new Aeth(null,'ry').to_english()]}(toward) & {[new Aeth(null,'fy').to_english()]}(to go)</b>. When a sentence must break the word order, commas are used:
    - <b>{[new Construction("library toward to_go")]}</b>, "I am going to the library."
    - <b>{[new Construction("library from, home toward to_go")]}</b>, "I am going home, from the library."

LIETAL GUIDE
  UNDE : Lietal
  BREF : The {(Lietal Guide)} goes more in-depth with the {(Lietal)} language.
  LONG
    & This {*Lietal Guide*} is a work in progress, and aims to cover every word-type of the {(Lietal)} Aebeth.
    * Design Notes
    & The Aeth table is meant to associate the elementary Lietal particles with their closest english equivalents, but in some cases, the resulting word might look a bit strange, this section of the documentation will try to explain the choices made.
    & For instance, the Lietal <b>{[new Aeth(null,'fa').adultspeak]}</b>, is quite a way away from its English counter part "to see". In Lietal, the {*a*} declension of {*yf*} is meant as an action that operates on the observers themselves, but not on each other, but "to see", or even "sight" doesn't quite capture that meaning.
    * Traverse-Type(K)
    & {*Traverse*}-type words are meant to navigate a hierarchy, and are often used at the beginning of a sentence. To be {_at a place_}, in Lietal, is made explicit with the "{[new Construction('location')]}" marker, like <b>{[new Construction('location school')]}</b> for "{_at school_}", and <b>{[new Construction('child school')]}</b> for "{_in school_}".
    | {*kari*} | {[new Aeth(null,'kari').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'kari').to_english()]}
    | {*kara*} | {[new Aeth(null,'kara').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'kara').to_english()]}
    | {*karo*} | {[new Aeth(null,'karo').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'karo').to_english()]}
    * State-Type(T)
    & {*State*}-type words are meant to define the state of existence of something. Where <b>{[new Construction('psychologic')]}</b> will speak of the idea, or concept of a thing, <b>{[new Construction('phisionomic')]}</b> will speak of the shape of a thing, and <b>{[new Construction('physic')]}</b> will speak of the thing itself. The difference can be better explained when used in an action.
    | {*fiti*} | {[new Aeth(null,'fiti').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'fiti').to_english()]}
    | {*fita*} | {[new Aeth(null,'fita').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'fita').to_english()]}
    | {*fito*} | {[new Aeth(null,'fito').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'fito').to_english()]}
    * Scale-Type(D)
    & {*Scale*}-type words are used to define things that are made from life(machines, products), life-itself(fauna, flora) and things that makes life(time, space).
    - <b>{[new Construction('home future to_be')]}</b>, "I will be home"
    - <b>{[new Construction('you future to_see')]}</b>, "I will see you later"
    | {*diri*} | {[new Aeth(null,'diri').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'diri').to_english()]} | {*ridi*} | {[new Aeth(null,'ridi').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'ridi').to_english()]}
    | {*dira*} | {[new Aeth(null,'dira').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'dira').to_english()]} | {*rida*} | {[new Aeth(null,'rida').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'rida').to_english()]}
    | {*diro*} | {[new Aeth(null,'diro').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'diro').to_english()]} | {*rido*} | {[new Aeth(null,'rido').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'rido').to_english()]}
    * Direction-Type(R)
    & {*Direction*}-type words are used to change the attributes of a concept, to transition toward something other or to create a conceptual arrow.
    * Relation-Type(S)
    & {*Relation*}-type words will most often be used as particles to create the equivalence of English particles "{_and_}" and "{_with_}", or to create enumerations.
    - <b>{[new Construction("between'unit you I to_be")]}</b>, "Between you and I"
    | {*siri*} | {[new Aeth(null,'siri').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'siri').to_english()]}
    | {*sari*} | {[new Aeth(null,'sari').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'sari').to_english()]}
    | {*sori*} | {[new Aeth(null,'sori').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'sori').to_english()]}
    * Counter-Type(L)
    & {*Counter*}-type words are often used to create subject pronouns, or parts of larger concepts like months in a year, or an item in a series. A sentence, by default, is expected to be {*at the 1st person*}, if a pronoun has not already been declared, pronouns are often omitted when possible.
    - <b>({[new Construction('I')]}){[new Construction('to_go')]}</b>, "I am going"
    & Here are the {*basic Lietal pronouns*}:
    | {*lari*} | {[new Aeth(null,'lari').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'lari').to_english()]} | {*liri*} | {[new Aeth(null,'liri').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'liri').to_english()]}
    | {*lara*} | {[new Aeth(null,'lara').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'lara').to_english()]} | {*lira*} | {[new Aeth(null,'lira').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'lira').to_english()]}
    | {*laro*} | {[new Aeth(null,'laro').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'laro').to_english()]} | {*liro*} | {[new Aeth(null,'liro').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'liro').to_english()]}
    * Modality-Type(J)
    & {*Modality*}-type words are usually used to create words like "couldn't", "could", "must", or <b>{[new Construction('could_not')]}</b>, <b>{[new Construction('could')]}</b>, <b>{[new Construction('must')]}</b>.
    - <b>{[new Construction('must where to_go')]}</b>, "Where must I go?"
    - <b>{[new Construction('could who to_be')]}</b>, "Who might you be?"
    * Alignment-Type
    | {*vadi*} | {[new Aeth(null,'vadi').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'vadi').to_english()]} | {*vaka*} | {[new Aeth(null,'vaka').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'vaka').to_english()]}
    | {*vada*} | {[new Aeth(null,'vada').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'vada').to_english()]} | {*vafy*} | {[new Aeth(null,'vafy').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'vafy').to_english()]}
    | {*vado*} | {[new Aeth(null,'vado').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'vado').to_english()]} | {*valy*} | {[new Aeth(null,'valy').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'valy').to_english()]}
    * Action-Type(F)
    & {*Action*}-type words are usually used at the end of a sentence and are generally built from the {_fy_} family.The sentence "I take the book home" is translated to <b>{[new Construction("child home book to_take")]}</b>, following the {#K T F#} structure. Or another example, "I give you the book", could be translated to <b>{[new Construction("child book you to_give")]}</b>, following the {#K T L F#} structure.
    | {*fora*} | {[new Aeth(null,'fora').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'fora').to_english()]} | {*faroti*} | {[new Aeth(null,'faroti').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'faroti').to_english()]}
    | {*fore*} | {[new Aeth(null,'fore').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'fore').to_english()]} | {*fiki*} | {[new Aeth(null,'fiki').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'fiki').to_english()]}
    | {*fori*} | {[new Aeth(null,'fori').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'fori').to_english()]} | {*fiko*} | {[new Aeth(null,'fiko').adultspeak]} | {[new Aeth(null,'fiko').to_english()]}

    & In general, if a {*new subject is introduced*} where another had been previously understood, signal the change by placing は after the subject. If a subject is understood, but for some reason not deleted use が or nothing.
    & An indicator of a specific points in {*time*} is usually followed by に, a word like "tomorrow" can only be understood by context and does not need the particle added.
    | 十月に | じゅう　がつ　に | In October
    | 三月三日に | さん　がつ　みっか　に | On March 3rd
    & <b>Indirect objects</b> are also followed by に, similar to the english expression "to you".
    | この本をあなたに上げる | この | ほんを | なたなに | あげる | I'm going to give this book to you.
    & The {*place*} you do something or the {*thing*} you use to do something is followed by で.
    | 車で行く　くるま　で　いく　 Going by car
    & An {*object*} is followed by を or nothing.
    | 本を読んでいる | ほん　を　よんで　いる | I'm reading a book.
    & Use も to <b>add extra info</b> on top of what has already been declared, not unlike the english word "too", as in "me too".
    | ぼくも行く | ぼく　も　いく | I'm going too.
    & Indicate {*possession*} by using の following an object, not unlike the english possession particle "'s", as in "Devine's".
    | これはぼくの本です | これ　は　ぼく　の　ほん　です | This is my book
    & A verb in a {*question*} sentence is followed by か.
    | 何時ですか | なんじ　です　か | What time is it?
    & Between {*choices*}, each choice is also followed by か.
    | 今日か明日？ | きょう　か　あした | Today or tomorrow?
    & A verb in a sentence that shares a sort of {*agreement*} with the listener is followed by ね, not unlike the english expression "isn't?".
    | 多能しいですね | たのうしい　です　ね | It's fun isn't it?
    & Adjectives always end in あい, いい, うい or おい, never in えい that would be a noun. Basically, you replace the ending い to inflect.
    | 優しい | やさしい | It's nice
    | 優しくない | やさしくない | It's not nice
    | 優しかった | やさしかった | It was nice
    | 優しかったら | やさしかったら | If it's nice
    & The ーる verbs that end in like たべる and いれる. There is always an い or an え before ーる. For these verbs, everything is done by dropping or replacing ーる with something else.
    | {_食べ_}る | Eating
    | {_食べ_}ます | (Polite)
    | {_食べ_}て | Gerund
    | {_食べ_}た | I ate it.
    | {_食べ_}やすい | This is easy to eat.
    | {_食べ_}たら | If I/someone eats.
    | {_食べ_}たり | I did things like eating
    | {_食べ_}れば | If I/someone eats.
    | {_食べ_}よう | Let's eat.
    | {_食べ_}ろ | Eat dammit!
    | {_食べ_}ないでよ | Don't eat that!
    | {_食べ_}られる | I can eat
    | {_食べ_}られるない | I can't eat this!
    | {_食べ_}させる | Make someone do
    | {_食べ_}させない　で　よ | Don't make me eat this!
    | {_食べ_}させられる | Be made to eat
    & These verbs end in う, く, ぐ, ぶ, む, ぬ, す, つ, or ある・いる・うる・える・おる. Typically you drop ーう and add something else. The problem is that there might be a phonetic change, such as when は becomes ぱ, or た becomes だ.
    | {*talk*}  | はな   | 話す  | 話して | 話しった  | 話したら   | 話せ | 話さない | 話せる
    | {*walk*}  | きく   | きく　 | きいて  | 聞いた   | 聞いたら | 聞け | 聞かない  | 聞ける
    | {*swim*}  | およぐ  | 泳ぐ | 泳いでる | 泳いだ   | 泳いだら | 泳げ | 泳がない | 泳げる
    | {*call*}  | よび   | 呼ぶ　 | 呼んで  | 呼んだ   | 呼んだら | 呼べ  | 呼ばない  | 呼べる
    | {*drink*} | ぬも   | 飲む　 | 飲んで  | 飲んだ   | 飲んだら | 飲め  | 飲まない  | 飲める
    | {*die*}   | しぬ   | 死ぬ　 | 死んで  | 死んだ   | 死んだら | 死ね  | 死なない  | 死ねる
    | {*make*}  | つくる | 作る　 | 作って | つ作った  | 作ったら | 作れ | 作らない | 作れる
    | {*wait*}  | まて   | 待つ　 | 待って  | 待った   | 待ったら |  | 待たない | 待てる
    | {*pay*}   | はらう  | 払う | 払って | 払った  | 払ったら | 払え | 払わない | 払える
    & There are some ーう verbs that end in ーる like ある(to be), おる(to break) and うる(to sell) are ーう verbs as they do not have an い or え sound before ーる.
    & If you see one that ends in ーいる or ーえる, and ーう changes to add ーます, or the "t" doubles to get a gerund (入る「はいる」　＞　入って「はいって」), then you're dealing with an ーう verb.
    & Most books say that there are only two irregular verbs in all of Japanese: する and 来る「くる」. Those you have to memorize separately, but they kind of make sense when you look at them.
    | 来る | will come                        | する　 | will do
    | 来て | come here                        | して　 | do this
    | 来た | someone came                     | した　 | someone did
    | 来たら | if someone comes                | したら | if someone does
    | 来たり | do things like come             | したり　 | do things like doing
    | 来れば | if someone comes                | すれば | if someone does
    | 来よう | let's come                      | しよう | let's do
    | 来い | come here you!                   | しろ | do this dammit!
    | 来ない | won't come, or doesn't come    | しない | won't do, or doesn't do
    | 来らせる | can come                      | できる | can do
    | 来させる | make someone come             | させる | make someone do
    | 来られる | ?                             | される | be done
    | 来させられる | be made to come by someone  | させられる | be made to do by someone
    & A trick to remember する conjugations is that they often match what you would get if you conjugated a lone す.　Like はな<b>した</b>, はな<b>せる</b>, はな<b>させる</b>.

    & Below are the organized and templated notes from my {(Russian)} studies.
    & They might serve you as a good basis to get into the language. This series of notes is inspired from Tad Perry's 1992 {_Quick and Dirty Guide to Japanese_}.
    & {*The nominative*} is the basic(dictionary) form of the noun when removed from context.
    # {*Студентка*} задала вопрос <comment>The student asked a question.</comment>

    | The window was there |  Окн{*о*} был{*о*} там

    & It's amazing how many sentences can be made with knowing these simple 3 words: нет, был & будет.
    | The student is at home.      |  Студент дома.
    | The student is not at home.  |  Студента {*нет*} дома.

    | It is cold           | холодно        | It was cold      | было холодно         | It will be cold      | будет холодно
    | It is not cold       | не холодно     | It was not cold  | не было холодно      | It will not be cold  | не быдет холодно

    & This is the basic conjugation table for a few simple Russian verbs. I always kept this nearby, for reference.
    | {*To Read         | {*To Write       | {*To Have        | {*To Speak         | {*To See*}

    | они {_чита_}ют    | они {_пиш_}ут    | они {_име_}ут    | они {_говор_}ят    | они {_вид_}ят
    & A few motion verbs like ходить(to go, to come) and идти can be prefixed to create new motion verbs.
    | to go, to walk            |  ходить
    | to come, to arrive        |  при<i>ходить</i>
    | to pass by                |  про<i>ходить</i>

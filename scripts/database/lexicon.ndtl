    & The goal of this project is to distribute a lightweight operating system that would serve a cli environment allowing the user to {navigate the file system(https://twitter.com/neauoire/status/1042644335689261058)}, its applications and to exchange content with other users using the basic interaction scheme of {(Paradise)}.
    # create the machine
    # > |
    & There would be no "users", "files" or "applications", all these would be combined into the operable "vessel" paradigm. A {λ(bold "vessel")} is an kind of {λ(ital "application")} that can act onto other vessels, it has its own permissions. Users are not different from applications or files. A {λ(ital "user")}, is a vessel being acted upon, possibly containing other vessels. A {λ(ital "file")} is an inert vessel, that has no applicable actions to itself.
    # enter the machine
    # > |
    & A basic vessel would have the basic actions of Paradise(enter, leave, take, drop, ...), and visible vessels might append to that list, actions of their own. The vessel format serves endpoints that respond to actions. For instance, an telephone vessel, might respond to the action {λ(ital "use")}, as in the command "use the telephone", which might or might not be what the acting vessel intended for. — Or, a more Parade-like vessel would be that of a contact card vessel granting the action {λ(ital "call")}, as in "call alex".
    & There is no linear hierarchy tree, instead vessels can be within themselves or each other, or even organized in the shape of a loop. Pockets of space can be hosts to vessels existing around a common purpose, or carried around inside another vessel as you would a tool-belt or an inventory, giving the acting vessel, or {λ(ital "user")}, additional actions and options.
    # become the machine
    # > |
    & One of the targets of this operating system is to be {λ(bold "fully operable without a monitor")}, via voice. The navigation is designed to be used via simple text commands, there would be nothing quite like windows. Vessels could display passive content when in sight, allowing to create a form of procedural user interface, but the system itself does not have a concept of windows, like you would in a typical graphical operating system with a wm.
    & While the navigation of the system can be done by voice alone, the terminal, when presented on a screen, has an {λ(bold "input")}, a {λ(bold "history of responses")} from previous actions and a {λ(bold "display area for graphics")}.
    # use the machine
    # > |
    & At its core the system should be {λ(bold "single-threaded")}, and operate a single frame, or a {λ(ital "state")}, of the world at a time, as a singular runtime. While passive responses of visible vessels might allow for a kind of oversight, the user experience as a terminal, and down to its functioning should not allow for multi-tasking.
    & The creation of application vessels, think for instance a {λ(ital "drawing application")}, would be built with the LISP dialect of Parade, which is itself built with that same language. — Making the entire operating system existing it inself as a vessel, editable, changeable, operable and navigable.
    # warp to the lobby@29:03:25:76
    # > |
    & A {λ(bold "Network of Parade systems")} would be traversible by an acting vessel. The Parade's typical behaviours for moving about will persist onto the remote systems so, vessel can move, enter, use remove vessels — while respecting the typical vessel permissions. For instance, a vessel might make itself usable by a visiting vessel, but will not let itself be moved or altered.

    * Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    * Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black and white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    * Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.

    & The day ends with {journaling(Journal)} at which point I record the task done, and if any, the {lessons learnt(Mirrors)}. I usually go to sleep with a {book(Directory)}, and a highlighter pen. I overline the things I want to keep for a later use, or to revisit.

SOLARPUNK
  UNDE : Lifestyle
  BREF : The {(Solarpunk)} diaries.
  BODY
    & {Solarpunks(Solarpunk)} cherish both {λ(bold "nature and progress")}, the {λ(bold "individual and the community")}.
    & They believe in a world that is {λ(bold "green, colourful, and bright")}. It can be described as a literary genre, an aesthetic, or a movement. The key points are:
    - A demand for technology and society to re-centre around {λ(bold "sustainability, longevity, and balance")} with an emphasis on {λ(bold "renewable energy")}.
    - A focus on {λ(bold "decentralisation, community activism, social justice and civic empowerment")}.
    - A recognition that {λ(bold "economic, social, and ecological injustices")} are all deeply {λ(bold "inter-connected")}.
    & We're destroying the world because we are, in a very literal and deliberate way, at war with it. People need more than to be made to feel stupid and guilty. They need more than a vision of doom. They need a vision of the world and of themselves that inspires them.
    & Solarpunk is the opposite of cyberpunk’s nihilism, offering “ingenuity, positive creation, independence, and community.”
    @ We’re {Solarpunks(solarpunk)} because the only other options are denial or despair. | Adam Flynn | Notes toward a manifesto | https://hieroglyph.asu.edu/2014/09/Solarpunk-notes-toward-a-manifesto/

    - Discusses alternatives & opinions
    & {λ(bold "Reference")} guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.

    - {λ(bold "Describes the machinery")}
    - References material should be austere and to the point.
    - Structure the documentation around the code
    - Do nothing but describe

    & Crouched over a small heap of cogs, he did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine.
    & His gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the hoarded studio.
    & What I first perceived as a pile of junk turned out to be a beautiful clock; where the needles would have been, a small hand rested at the tip of a short metallic arm.
    & My friend held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto the opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged and plucked a gear out of its entrails and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core exposed.
    & I stared in silent awe, at the busy mechanical concerto playing its own requiem. The arms eventually began to reach inside the mechanism, unbuilding its core, growing weaker as it dismantled the heavier components and moved them back into the toolbox. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and exposé on pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had fallen back into the toolbox.

    * Phonology
    & Building words from Lietal's phonemes is called {λ(bold "Childspeak")}. It makes for long rhythmical and syllabic words, its main usage is in loan words and to express of emphasis and exclamation. This documentation uses the phonetically denser form {λ(bold "Adultspeak")} where patterns of duplicated consonants and vowels are condensed.
    | CVCV | {λ(bold "lili")} > {λ(adultspeak "lili")} | {λ(bold "falili")} > {λ(adultspeak "falili")} | {λ(bold "fafalili")} > {λ(adultspeak "fafalili")}   
    | CVCv | {λ(bold "lila")} > {λ(adultspeak "lila")} | {λ(bold "falila")} > {λ(adultspeak "falila")} | {λ(bold "fafolila")} > {λ(adultspeak "fafolila")}   
    | CVcV | {λ(bold "viki")} > {λ(adultspeak "viki")} | {λ(bold "faviki")} > {λ(adultspeak "faviki")} | {λ(bold "fafoviki")} > {λ(adultspeak "fafoviki")}   
    | CVcv | {λ(bold "lika")} > {λ(adultspeak "lika")} | {λ(bold "falika")} > {λ(adultspeak "falika")} | {λ(bold "favolika")} > {λ(adultspeak "favolika")}   
    & A single syllable of childspeak is reversed, so "vo" becomes <b>{λ(adultspeak "vo")}</b>. A sequence of consonant, like "lyla", is condensed into <b>{λ(adultspeak "lyla")}</b>. A sequence of vowels, like "lara", is condensed into <b>{λ(adultspeak "lara")}</b>, in which an extra vowel is added between the two consonants. 
    > {λ(deconstruct "lytadota")}
    & When no sequence of consonants or vowels are present, an extra vowel is also added between the consonants, so "lira", is transformed into <b>{λ(adultspeak "lira")}</b>.

    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "library" "from"))}, {λ(enli "home" "toward" "to go")}</b>, "I am going home, from the library."
    * Reference
    & {λ(bold "Traverse")}-type words are meant to navigate a hierarchy, and are often used at the beginning of a sentence. To be {λ(ital "at a place")}, in Lietal, is made explicit with the "{λ(enli "location")}" marker, like <b>{λ(enli "location" "school")}</b> for "{λ(ital "at school")}", and <b>{λ(enli "child" "school")}</b> for "{λ(ital "in school")}".
    & {λ(bold "State")}-type words are meant to define the state of existence of something. Where <b>{λ(enli "psychologic")}</b> will speak of the idea, or concept of a thing, <b>{λ(enli "phisionomic")}</b> will speak of the shape of a thing, and <b>{λ(enli "physic")}</b> will speak of the thing itself. The difference can be better explained when used in an action, or with the examples: <b>{λ(adultspeak "fiti")}</b>({λ(lien "fiti")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "fita")}</b>({λ(lien "fita")}) & <b>{λ(adultspeak "fito")}</b>({λ(lien "fito")}).
    & {λ(bold "Scale")}-type words are used to define things that are made <b>{λ(adultspeak "do")}</b>(machines, products), from life-itself <b>{λ(adultspeak "da")}</b>(fauna, flora) and from things that makes life <b>{λ(adultspeak "di")}</b>(time, space).
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "home" "future" "to be"))}</b>, "I will be home"
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "you" "future" "to see"))}</b>, "I will see you later"
    & {λ(bold "Direction")}-type words are used to change the attributes of a concept, to transition toward something other or to create a conceptual arrow.
    & {λ(bold "Relation")}-type words will most often be used as particles to create the equivalence of English particles "{λ(ital "and")}" and "{λ(ital "with")}", or to create enumerations.
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "between" "you" "i"))}</b>, "Between you and I"
    & {λ(bold "Counter")}-type words are often used to create subject pronouns, or parts of larger concepts like months in a year, or an item in a series. A sentence, by default, is expected to be {λ(bold "at the 1st person")}, if a pronoun has not already been declared, pronouns are often omitted when possible. The basic Lietal singular pronouns are <b>{λ(adultspeak "lari")}</b>({λ(lien "lari")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "lara")}</b>({λ(lien "lara")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "laro")}</b>({λ(lien "laro")}). The basic plural pronouns are <b>{λ(adultspeak "liri")}</b>({λ(lien "liri")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "lira")}</b>({λ(lien "lira")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "liro")}</b>({λ(lien "liro")}).
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "I" "to go"))}</b>, "I am going"
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "they" "to go"))}</b>, "They are going"    
    & {λ(bold "Modality")}-type words are usually used to create words like "couldn't", "could", "must", or <b>{λ(enli "could not")}</b>, <b>{λ(enli "could")}</b>, <b>{λ(enli "must")}</b>.
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "must" "where" "to go"))}</b>, "Where must I go?"
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "could" "who" "to be"))}</b>, "Who might you be?"
    & {λ(bold "Alignment")}-type words are used to express a standing on a specific topic, for example, to express that something is wanted or not. Many of the daily expressions of greetings are also created from <b>{λ(enli "positive")}</b>, for example, <b>{λ(enli "welcome")}</b>(welcome) is made from <b>{λ(enli "positive")}</b>(positive) & <b>{λ(enli "inward")}</b>(inward). This pattern can be expanded to mean things like <b>{λ(enli "well done")}</b>(well done), or even <b>{λ(enli "health")}</b>(health).
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "welcome" "how"))}?</b>, "Hello, how are you?"
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "bye"))}, {λ(enli "soon" "to see")}!</b>, "Good Bye, see you soon!"
    & {λ(bold "Action")}-type words are usually used at the end of a sentence and are generally built from the {λ(ital "fy")} family. The sentence "I take the book home" is translated to <b>{λ(enli "child" "book" "home" "to take")}</b>, following the {λ(code "K T F")} structure. Or another example, "I give you the book", could be translated to <b>{λ(enli "child" "book" "you" "to give")}</b>, following the {λ(code "K T L F")} structure.
    - <b>Lietal {λ(enli "possible" "to understand")}?</b>, "Can you understand Lietal?".

    * Sentence Word Order
    & In general, the main verb is found at the end of the sentence. Subjects are shown in grey as they are very often omitted. The preposition follows the noun, it is more properly called a postposition(て、に、お、は). They are not independent words but particles by which the case of nouns is determined.
    @ I'm going to give a present to my teacher tomorrow at school.
    | <span style='color:#999'>Subject</span>  | {λ(bold "Time")}   | {λ(bold "Place")}    | {λ(bold "Indirect")} | {λ(bold "Object")}      | {λ(bold "Action Verb")}
    | <span style='color:#999'>私は</span>      | 明日   | 学校で     | 先生に    | プレゼントを   | <b>上げます</b>
    | <span style='color:#999'>わたくしは</span> | あした  | がっこうで | せんせいに  | ぷれぜんとを | <b>あげます</b>
    * Particles
    - Use は after the subject, if a {λ(bold "new subject is introduced")} where another had been previously understood. If a subject is understood, but for some reason not deleted use が, or nothing.
    - Use に to indicate a specific points in {λ(bold "time")}, a word like "tomorrow"（明日） can only be understood by context and does not need the particle added. Like "In October", or 十月に — or like "On March 3rd", or 三月三日に. <b>Indirect objects</b> are also followed by に, similar to the english expression "to you", as seen in the following sentence "I'm going to give this book to you.", or この本をあなたに上げる.
    - Use で after the {λ(bold "place")} you do something or the {λ(bold "thing")} you use to do something. For example, "Going by car", is 車で行く.
    - Use を after a noun to declare an {λ(bold "object")}, as seen in the following sentence "I'm reading a book", or 本を読んでいる.
    - Use も to <b>add extra info</b> on top of what has already been declared, not unlike the english word "too", as in "me too". For example, "I'm going too", is ぼくも行く.
    - Use の to indicate {λ(bold "possession")} after an object, similarly to the english possession particle "'s", as in "Alex's". For example, "This is my book" is これはぼくの本です.
    - Use か at the end of a sentence to create a {λ(bold "question")}, as in "What time is it?", or 何時ですか? Or, between {λ(bold "choices")}, each choice is also followed by か. As in "Today or tomorrow?", or 今日か明日？
    - Use ね after a verb to create a sort of {λ(bold "agreement")} with the listener, not unlike the english expression "isn't?", in "It's fun isn't it?", or たのうしいですね.
    * Nouns
    & Nouns have no inflection to indicate singularity or plurality, for example, こども means both child and children. When wishing to show the plural of a noun, an indicator such as ーら、ーたち are attached, as in こどもたち, meaning children. Generally, the plural distinction is not made, but is left to be understood from the context.
    * Adjectives
    & Adjectives always end in あい, いい, うい or おい, never in えい that would be a noun. Basically, you replace the ending い to inflect.
    | 優しい | やさしい | It's nice
    | 優しくない | やさしくない | It's not nice
    | 優しかった | やさしかった | It was nice
    | 優しかったら | やさしかったら | If it's nice
    * Verbs
    & The ーる verbs that end in like たべる and いれる. There is always an い or an え before ーる. For these verbs, everything is done by dropping or replacing ーる with something else.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}る | Eating
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}ます | (Polite)
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}て | Gerund
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}た | I ate it.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}やすい | This is easy to eat.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}たら | If I/someone eats.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}たり | I did things like eating
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}れば | If I/someone eats.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}よう | Let's eat.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}ろ | Eat dammit!
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}ないでよ | Don't eat that!
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}られる | I can eat
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}られるない | I can't eat this!
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}させる | Make someone do
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}させない　で　よ | Don't make me eat this!
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}させられる | Be made to eat
    & These verbs end in う, く, ぐ, ぶ, む, ぬ, す, つ, or ある・いる・うる・える・おる. Typically you drop ーう and add something else. The problem is that there might be a phonetic change, such as when は becomes ぱ, or た becomes だ.
    | {λ(bold "talk")}  | はな   | 話す  | 話して | 話しった  | 話したら   | 話せ | 話さない | 話せる
    | {λ(bold "walk")}  | きく   | きく　 | きいて  | 聞いた   | 聞いたら | 聞け | 聞かない  | 聞ける
    | {λ(bold "swim")}  | およぐ  | 泳ぐ | 泳いでる | 泳いだ   | 泳いだら | 泳げ | 泳がない | 泳げる
    | {λ(bold "call")}  | よび   | 呼ぶ　 | 呼んで  | 呼んだ   | 呼んだら | 呼べ  | 呼ばない  | 呼べる
    | {λ(bold "drink")} | ぬも   | 飲む　 | 飲んで  | 飲んだ   | 飲んだら | 飲め  | 飲まない  | 飲める
    | {λ(bold "die")}   | しぬ   | 死ぬ　 | 死んで  | 死んだ   | 死んだら | 死ね  | 死なない  | 死ねる
    | {λ(bold "make")}  | つくる | 作る　 | 作って | つ作った  | 作ったら | 作れ | 作らない | 作れる
    | {λ(bold "wait")}  | まて   | 待つ　 | 待って  | 待った   | 待ったら |  | 待たない | 待てる
    | {λ(bold "pay")}   | はらう  | 払う | 払って | 払った  | 払ったら | 払え | 払わない | 払える
    & There are some ーう verbs that end in ーる like ある(to be), おる(to break) and うる(to sell) are ーう verbs as they do not have an い or え sound before ーる.
    & If you see one that ends in ーいる or ーえる, and ーう changes to add ーます, or the "t" doubles to get a gerund (入る「はいる」　＞　入って「はいって」), then you're dealing with an ーう verb.
    & Most books say that there are only two irregular verbs in all of Japanese: する and 来る「くる」. Those you have to memorize separately, but they kind of make sense when you look at them.
    | 来る | will come                        | する　 | will do
    | 来て | come here                        | して　 | do this
    | 来た | someone came                     | した　 | someone did
    | 来たら | if someone comes                | したら | if someone does
    | 来たり | do things like come             | したり　 | do things like doing
    | 来れば | if someone comes                | すれば | if someone does
    | 来よう | let's come                      | しよう | let's do
    | 来い | come here you!                   | しろ | do this dammit!
    | 来ない | won't come, or doesn't come    | しない | won't do, or doesn't do
    | 来らせる | can come                      | できる | can do
    | 来させる | make someone come             | させる | make someone do
    | 来られる | ?                             | される | be done
    | 来させられる | be made to come by someone  | させられる | be made to do by someone
    & A trick to remember する conjugations is that they often match what you would get if you conjugated a lone す.　Like はな<b>した</b>, はな<b>せる</b>, はな<b>させる</b>.

    & Below are the organized and templated notes from my {(Russian)} studies.
    & They might serve you as a good basis to get into the language. This series of notes is inspired from Tad Perry's 1992 {λ(ital "Quick and Dirty Guide to Japanese")}.

PARADE
  UNDE : Paradise
  BREF : {λ(link "Parade")} is an experimental operating system inspired from {λ(link "Paradise")}.
  BODY
    & The {λ(bold "Parade")} is an experimental operating system using {λ(link "Paradise")} as a {λ(ital "filesystem")}.
    & The goal of this project is to distribute a lightweight operating system that would serve a cli environment allowing the user to {λ(link "https://twitter.com/neauoire/status/1042644335689261058" "navigate the file system")}, its applications and to exchange content with other users using the basic interaction scheme of {λ(link "Paradise")}.
    # create the machine
    # > |
    & There would be no "users", "files" or "applications", all these would be combined into the operable "vessel" paradigm. A {λ(bold "vessel")} is an kind of {λ(ital "application")} that can act onto other vessels, it has its own permissions. Users are not different from applications or files. A {λ(ital "user")}, is a vessel being acted upon, possibly containing other vessels. A {λ(ital "file")} is an inert vessel, that has no applicable actions to itself.
    # enter the machine
    # > |
    & A basic vessel would have the basic actions of Paradise(enter, leave, take, drop, ...), and visible vessels might append to that list, actions of their own. The vessel format serves endpoints that respond to actions. For instance, an telephone vessel, might respond to the action {λ(ital "use")}, as in the command "use the telephone", which might or might not be what the acting vessel intended for. — Or, a more Parade-like vessel would be that of a contact card vessel granting the action {λ(ital "call")}, as in "call alex".
    & There is no linear hierarchy tree, instead vessels can be within themselves or each other, or even organized in the shape of a loop. Pockets of space can be hosts to vessels existing around a common purpose, or carried around inside another vessel as you would a tool-belt or an inventory, giving the acting vessel, or {λ(ital "user")}, additional actions and options.
    # become the machine
    # > |
    & One of the targets of this operating system is to be {λ(bold "fully operable without a monitor")}, via voice. The navigation is designed to be used via simple text commands, there would be nothing quite like windows. Vessels could display passive content when in sight, allowing to create a form of procedural user interface, but the system itself does not have a concept of windows, like you would in a typical graphical operating system with a wm.
    & While the navigation of the system can be done by voice alone, the terminal, when presented on a screen, has an {λ(bold "input")}, a {λ(bold "history of responses")} from previous actions and a {λ(bold "display area for graphics")}.
    # use the machine
    # > |
    & At its core the system should be {λ(bold "single-threaded")}, and operate a single frame, or a {λ(ital "state")}, of the world at a time, as a singular runtime. While passive responses of visible vessels might allow for a kind of oversight, the user experience as a terminal, and down to its functioning should not allow for multi-tasking.
    & The creation of application vessels, think for instance a {λ(ital "drawing application")}, would be built with the LISP dialect of Parade, which is itself built with that same language. — Making the entire operating system existing it inself as a vessel, editable, changeable, operable and navigable.
    # warp to the lobby@29:03:25:76
    # > |
    & A {λ(bold "Network of Parade systems")} would be traversible by an acting vessel. The Parade's typical behaviours for moving about will persist onto the remote systems so, vessel can move, enter, use remove vessels — while respecting the typical vessel permissions. For instance, a vessel might make itself usable by a visiting vessel, but will not let itself be moved or altered.

    * Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    * Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black and white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    * Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.

    & The suffocating curiousity of wanting to know how different my life might be, had gotten worse than the daily frictions of my current situation. The decision of living aboard a {λ(link "Pino" "float home")} was not picked amongst other equally enticing ideas, for it was, at the time, the only solution that would align with what I wanted in life. 
    & The monthly rent of our beachside Tokyo appartment was of about 1.5K$, and transitioning from it, to a sailboat, implicated some serious downsizing. The way we looked at it was that, within 3 years, our 20K$ sailboat would be paid at the rate of 600$ per month — Or that by cutting the costs of our current living situation in half, we could be both "home owners" and keep our traveling options open.

    & The wind rocks the habitat sideways, keeping you up at night. But at least, you get to spend your day writing. You forget about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, you wonder why people take showers every day, and time away from social networks really does make you feel better.
    @ Being nomad is trading the things you think you care about, for things you didn't know existed.
    & Suddenly, it's business as usual. You get back to building things, only now, when you look outside, the upmost gorgeous sunset precedes the darkest of night.
    & You learnt how to fix sails, repair a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine — Even to live without a fridge and power.

    & The human body is mostly made of proteins, and proteins are made of amino acids - permutations of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sometimes sulphur. There are 22 amino acids in total and all but 9 can be synthesized, the {λ(bold "Essential Amino Acids")}.
    & To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs have access to the full sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is missing, the unusable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or sugars.
    & Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a complete protein(see {λ(ital "Limiting Amino Acids")}) are oats, garbanzo beans, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice, peanuts and pumpkin seeds.
    & There are also high-quality proteins in green beans, swiss chard, broccoli, mustard greens, asparagus and potatoes but in lesser quantity.
    & Soy products have within them 100% of a complete protein, or the correct ratio of essential amino acids for the body to use in tissue growth and repair.
    & The high-quality protein foods can be made whole by combining with other ingredients, but the basic optimal combinations is {λ(bold "Beans with grains, nuts or seeds")}.

    @ In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness. | Antoine de St. Exupery | Terre des Hommes | https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terre_des_hommes
    * Free Will
    @ There's no free will, says the philosopher; To hang is most unjust.<br />There is no free will, assents the officer; We hang because we must. | Ambrose Bierce | Epigrams
    * Body Without Organs
    @ When you will have made him a body without organs, then you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions and restored him to his true freedom. | Antonin Artaud | To Have Done with the Judgment of God | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_without_organs
    @ The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain. | Ursula K. Le Guin | The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas    
    * No 44
    @ In a little while you will be alone in shoreless space, to wander its limitless solitudes without friend or comrade forever - for you will remain a thought, the only existent thought, and by your nature inextinguishable, indestructible. | Mark Twain | The Mysterious Stranger | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Stranger
    @ There is no future. There is no past. {λ(bold "Time")} is simultaneous, an intricately structured jewel that humans insist on viewing one edge at a time, when the whole design is visible in every facet. | Alan Moore | Watchmen | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen
    * Infinite World Ethics
    @ If the cosmos is finite, then our own comparative smallness does not necessarily undermine the idea that our conduct matters even from an impersonal perspective.<br /><br />But if the cosmos is infinite, and we can but do a finite amount of good or bad. In cardinal arithmetic, adding or subtracting a finite quantity does not change an infinite quantity. Every possible act of ours therefore has the same net effect on the total amount of good and bad in a canonically infinite world: none whatsoever. | Nick Bostrom | Infinite Ethics | https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/infinite.pdf
    * Hermeneutic Circle
    @ Hovering in the background, like a specter, the ultimate possibility of no possibility, of no-more-being-there, the possibility of impossibility. What ultimately lies ahead for Dasein, its uttermost potentiality, is {λ(link "Death")}. | John D. Caputo | Hermeneutic: Facts and Interpretation | https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/294637/hermeneutics/
    @ The Victorious Ones have announced that {λ(link "Buddhism" "emptiness")} is the relinquishing of all views. Those who are possessed of the view of emptiness are said to be incorrigible. | Verse | Mūlamadhyamakakārikā | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mūlamadhyamakakārikā

    & Bourland sees specifically the "identity" and "predication" functions as pernicious, but advocates eliminating all forms for the sake of simplicity. In the case of the "existence" form (and less idiomatically, the "location" form), one might (for example) simply substitute the verb "exists".
    & Other copula-substitutes in English include taste, feel, smell, sound, grow, remain, stay, and turn, among others a user of E-prime might use instead of "to be".

    & It was just three days before Christmas when my friend invited me to his workshop to witness the completion of his latest project.
    & Crouched over a small heap of cogs, he did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine.
    & His gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the hoarded studio.
    & What I first perceived as a pile of junk turned out to be a beautiful clock; where the needles would have been, a small hand rested at the tip of a short metallic arm.
    & My friend held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto the opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged and plucked a gear out of its entrails and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core exposed.
    & I stared in silent awe, at the busy mechanical concerto playing its own requiem. The arms eventually began to reach inside the mechanism, unbuilding its core, growing weaker as it dismantled the heavier components and moved them back into the toolbox. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and exposé on pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had fallen back into the toolbox.

    * Phonology
    & Building words from Lietal's phonemes is called {λ(bold "Childspeak")}. It makes for long rhythmical and syllabic words, its main usage is in loan words and to express of emphasis and exclamation. This documentation uses the phonetically denser form {λ(bold "Adultspeak")} where patterns of duplicated consonants and vowels are condensed.
    | CVCV | {λ(bold "lili")} > {λ(adultspeak "lili")} | {λ(bold "falili")} > {λ(adultspeak "falili")} | {λ(bold "fafalili")} > {λ(adultspeak "fafalili")}   
    | CVCv | {λ(bold "lila")} > {λ(adultspeak "lila")} | {λ(bold "falila")} > {λ(adultspeak "falila")} | {λ(bold "fafolila")} > {λ(adultspeak "fafolila")}   
    | CVcV | {λ(bold "viki")} > {λ(adultspeak "viki")} | {λ(bold "faviki")} > {λ(adultspeak "faviki")} | {λ(bold "fafoviki")} > {λ(adultspeak "fafoviki")}   
    | CVcv | {λ(bold "lika")} > {λ(adultspeak "lika")} | {λ(bold "falika")} > {λ(adultspeak "falika")} | {λ(bold "favolika")} > {λ(adultspeak "favolika")}   
    & A single syllable of childspeak is reversed, so "vo" becomes <b>{λ(adultspeak "vo")}</b>. A sequence of consonant, like "lyla", is condensed into <b>{λ(adultspeak "lyla")}</b>. A sequence of vowels, like "lara", is condensed into <b>{λ(adultspeak "lara")}</b>, in which an extra vowel is added between the two consonants. 
    > {λ(deconstruct "lytadota")}
    & When no sequence of consonants or vowels are present, an extra vowel is also added between the consonants, so "lira", is transformed into <b>{λ(adultspeak "lira")}</b>.

    & The following sequence of letters is the normal flow of a sentence, {λ(bold "when a sentence must break the word order, commas are used")}. Notice the word order in the following sentence, and specifically how a comma is used to join two sentences that would normaly break the word order.
    | K | T | D | R | S | L | J | V | F
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "library" "toward" "to go"))}</b>, "I am going to the library."
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "library" "from"))}, {λ(enli "home" "toward" "to go")}</b>, "I am going home, from the library."
    * Reference
    & {λ(bold "Traverse")}-type words are meant to navigate a hierarchy, and are often used at the beginning of a sentence. To be {λ(ital "at a place")}, in Lietal, is made explicit with the "{λ(enli "location")}" marker, like <b>{λ(enli "location" "school")}</b> for "{λ(ital "at school")}", and <b>{λ(enli "child" "school")}</b> for "{λ(ital "in school")}".
    & {λ(bold "State")}-type words are meant to define the state of existence of something. Where <b>{λ(enli "psychologic")}</b> will speak of the idea, or concept of a thing, <b>{λ(enli "phisionomic")}</b> will speak of the shape of a thing, and <b>{λ(enli "physic")}</b> will speak of the thing itself. The difference can be better explained when used in an action, or with the examples: <b>{λ(adultspeak "fiti")}</b>({λ(lien "fiti")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "fita")}</b>({λ(lien "fita")}) & <b>{λ(adultspeak "fito")}</b>({λ(lien "fito")}).
    & {λ(bold "Scale")}-type words are used to define things that are made <b>{λ(adultspeak "do")}</b>(machines, products), from life-itself <b>{λ(adultspeak "da")}</b>(fauna, flora) and from things that makes life <b>{λ(adultspeak "di")}</b>(time, space).
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "home" "future" "to be"))}</b>, "I will be home"
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "you" "future" "to see"))}</b>, "I will see you later"
    & {λ(bold "Direction")}-type words are used to change the attributes of a concept, to transition toward something other or to create a conceptual arrow.
    & {λ(bold "Relation")}-type words will most often be used as particles to create the equivalence of English particles "{λ(ital "and")}" and "{λ(ital "with")}", or to create enumerations.
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "between" "you" "i"))}</b>, "Between you and I"
    & {λ(bold "Counter")}-type words are often used to create subject pronouns, or parts of larger concepts like months in a year, or an item in a series. A sentence, by default, is expected to be {λ(bold "at the 1st person")}, if a pronoun has not already been declared, pronouns are often omitted when possible. The basic Lietal singular pronouns are <b>{λ(adultspeak "lari")}</b>({λ(lien "lari")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "lara")}</b>({λ(lien "lara")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "laro")}</b>({λ(lien "laro")}). The basic plural pronouns are <b>{λ(adultspeak "liri")}</b>({λ(lien "liri")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "lira")}</b>({λ(lien "lira")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "liro")}</b>({λ(lien "liro")}).
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "I" "to go"))}</b>, "I am going"
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "they" "to go"))}</b>, "They are going"    
    & {λ(bold "Modality")}-type words are usually used to create words like "couldn't", "could", "must", or <b>{λ(enli "could not")}</b>, <b>{λ(enli "could")}</b>, <b>{λ(enli "must")}</b>.
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "must" "where" "to go"))}</b>, "Where must I go?"
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "could" "who" "to be"))}</b>, "Who might you be?"
    & {λ(bold "Alignment")}-type words are used to express a standing on a specific topic, for example, to express that something is wanted or not. Many of the daily expressions of greetings are also created from <b>{λ(enli "positive")}</b>, for example, <b>{λ(enli "welcome")}</b>(welcome) is made from <b>{λ(enli "positive")}</b>(positive) & <b>{λ(enli "inward")}</b>(inward). This pattern can be expanded to mean things like <b>{λ(enli "well done")}</b>(well done), or even <b>{λ(enli "health")}</b>(health).
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "welcome" "how"))}?</b>, "Hello, how are you?"
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "bye"))}, {λ(enli "soon" "to see")}!</b>, "Good Bye, see you soon!"
    & {λ(bold "Action")}-type words are usually used at the end of a sentence and are generally built from the {λ(ital "fy")} family. The sentence "I take the book home" is translated to <b>{λ(enli "child" "book" "home" "to take")}</b>, following the {λ(code "K T F")} structure. Or another example, "I give you the book", could be translated to <b>{λ(enli "child" "book" "you" "to give")}</b>, following the {λ(code "K T L F")} structure.
    - <b>Lietal {λ(enli "possible" "to understand")}?</b>, "Can you understand Lietal?".
    - <b>{λ(cc (enli "child" "home" "to welcome"))}</b>, "I welcome you home".

    & I have formatted this guide to be a study tool prior to moving to {λ(link "Japan")} a few years ago, it requires the knowledge to {λ(bold "read Hiragana, Katakana and basic kanjis")}.
    * Sentence Word Order
    & In general, the main verb is found at the end of the sentence. Subjects are shown in grey as they are very often omitted. The preposition follows the noun, it is more properly called a postposition(て、に、お、は). They are not independent words but particles by which the case of nouns is determined.
    @ I'm going to give a present to my teacher tomorrow at school.
    | <span style='color:#999'>Subject</span>  | {λ(bold "Time")}   | {λ(bold "Place")}    | {λ(bold "Indirect")} | {λ(bold "Object")}      | {λ(bold "Action Verb")}
    | <span style='color:#999'>私は</span>      | 明日   | 学校で     | 先生に    | プレゼントを   | <b>上げます</b>
    | <span style='color:#999'>わたくしは</span> | あした  | がっこうで | せんせいに  | ぷれぜんとを | <b>あげます</b>
    * Particles
    - Use は after the subject, if a {λ(bold "new subject is introduced")} where another had been previously understood. If a subject is understood, but for some reason not deleted use が, or nothing.
    - Use に to indicate a specific points in {λ(bold "time")}, a word like "tomorrow"（明日） can only be understood by context and does not need the particle added. Like "In October", or 十月に — or like "On March 3rd", or 三月三日に. <b>Indirect objects</b> are also followed by に, similar to the english expression "to you", as seen in the following sentence "I'm going to give this book to you.", or この本をあなたに上げる.
    - Use で after the {λ(bold "place")} you do something or the {λ(bold "thing")} you use to do something. For example, "Going by car", is 車で行く.
    - Use を after a noun to declare an {λ(bold "object")}, as seen in the following sentence "I'm reading a book", or 本を読んでいる.
    - Use も to <b>add extra info</b> on top of what has already been declared, not unlike the english word "too", as in "me too". For example, "I'm going too", is ぼくも行く.
    - Use の to indicate {λ(bold "possession")} after an object, similarly to the english possession particle "'s", as in "Alex's". For example, "This is my book" is これはぼくの本です.
    - Use か at the end of a sentence to create a {λ(bold "question")}, as in "What time is it?", or 何時ですか? Or, between {λ(bold "choices")}, each choice is also followed by か. As in "Today or tomorrow?", or 今日か明日？
    - Use ね after a verb to create a sort of {λ(bold "agreement")} with the listener, not unlike the english expression "isn't?", in "It's fun isn't it?", or たのうしいですね.
    * Nouns
    & Nouns have no inflection to indicate singularity or plurality, for example, こども means both child and children. When wishing to show the plural of a noun, an indicator such as ーら、ーたち are attached, as in こどもたち, meaning children. Generally, the plural distinction is not made, but is left to be understood from the context.
    * Adjectives
    & Adjectives always end in あい, いい, うい or おい, never in えい that would be a noun. Basically, you replace the ending い to inflect.
    | 優しい | やさしい | It's nice
    | 優しくない | やさしくない | It's not nice
    | 優しかった | やさしかった | It was nice
    | 優しかったら | やさしかったら | If it's nice
    * Verbs
    & The ーる verbs that end in like たべる and いれる. There is always an い or an え before ーる. For these verbs, everything is done by dropping or replacing ーる with something else.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}る | Eating
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}ます | (Polite)
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}て | Gerund
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}た | I ate it.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}やすい | This is easy to eat.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}たら | If I/someone eats.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}たり | I did things like eating
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}れば | If I/someone eats.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}よう | Let's eat.
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}ろ | Eat dammit!
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}ないでよ | Don't eat that!
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}られる | I can eat
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}られるない | I can't eat this!
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}させる | Make someone do
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}させない　で　よ | Don't make me eat this!
    | {λ(ital "食べ")}させられる | Be made to eat
    & These verbs end in う, く, ぐ, ぶ, む, ぬ, す, つ, or ある・いる・うる・える・おる. Typically you drop ーう and add something else. The problem is that there might be a phonetic change, such as when は becomes ぱ, or た becomes だ.
    | {λ(bold "talk")}  | はな   | 話す  | 話して | 話しった  | 話したら   | 話せ | 話さない | 話せる
    | {λ(bold "walk")}  | きく   | きく　 | きいて  | 聞いた   | 聞いたら | 聞け | 聞かない  | 聞ける
    | {λ(bold "swim")}  | およぐ  | 泳ぐ | 泳いでる | 泳いだ   | 泳いだら | 泳げ | 泳がない | 泳げる
    | {λ(bold "call")}  | よび   | 呼ぶ　 | 呼んで  | 呼んだ   | 呼んだら | 呼べ  | 呼ばない  | 呼べる
    | {λ(bold "drink")} | ぬも   | 飲む　 | 飲んで  | 飲んだ   | 飲んだら | 飲め  | 飲まない  | 飲める
    | {λ(bold "die")}   | しぬ   | 死ぬ　 | 死んで  | 死んだ   | 死んだら | 死ね  | 死なない  | 死ねる
    | {λ(bold "make")}  | つくる | 作る　 | 作って | つ作った  | 作ったら | 作れ | 作らない | 作れる
    | {λ(bold "wait")}  | まて   | 待つ　 | 待って  | 待った   | 待ったら |  | 待たない | 待てる
    | {λ(bold "pay")}   | はらう  | 払う | 払って | 払った  | 払ったら | 払え | 払わない | 払える
    & There are some ーう verbs that end in ーる like ある(to be), おる(to break) and うる(to sell) are ーう verbs as they do not have an い or え sound before ーる.
    & If you see one that ends in ーいる or ーえる, and ーう changes to add ーます, or the "t" doubles to get a gerund (入る「はいる」　＞　入って「はいって」), then you're dealing with an ーう verb.
    & Most books say that there are only two irregular verbs in all of Japanese: する and 来る「くる」. Those you have to memorize separately, but they kind of make sense when you look at them.
    | 来る | will come                        | する　 | will do
    | 来て | come here                        | して　 | do this
    | 来た | someone came                     | した　 | someone did
    | 来たら | if someone comes                | したら | if someone does
    | 来たり | do things like come             | したり　 | do things like doing
    | 来れば | if someone comes                | すれば | if someone does
    | 来よう | let's come                      | しよう | let's do
    | 来い | come here you!                   | しろ | do this dammit!
    | 来ない | won't come, or doesn't come    | しない | won't do, or doesn't do
    | 来らせる | can come                      | できる | can do
    | 来させる | make someone come             | させる | make someone do
    | 来られる | ?                             | される | be done
    | 来させられる | be made to come by someone  | させられる | be made to do by someone
    & A trick to remember する conjugations is that they often match what you would get if you conjugated a lone す.　Like はな<b>した</b>, はな<b>せる</b>, はな<b>させる</b>.

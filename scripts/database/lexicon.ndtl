    & {*XXIIVV*} is a {digital playground(Oscean)} and personal {logging system(Horaire)}.
    & The aim of this project is to build a form of {*personal assistant*} to help with the management of a vast repository of {*recorded statistics*} which presently includes {λ(count (table "horaire"))} daily logs, recorded on {λ(count (keys (table "lexicon")))} projects, spanning over {λ(count (keys (value (Ø "database") "index")))} topics.
    & {(Oscean)} is designed to be fully static, and operate without the need for a localhost, nor a build process. — To be flexible as so to adapt to my needs as I change, and to technology as it evolves, while remaining maintainable by not only myself, but others.
    & Each part of this project should aim to persist across technological {*Long Term*}, not one part of it should be prebuilt, precompiled, or minified — Every method should be {*specific*}, {*unobfuscated*}, and each one carefully chosen against general-purpose libraries, frameworks or wasteful foreign entities.
    - {(Riven)}, a flow-based front-end engine.
    - {*Oscean*(Oscean)}, a wiki platform.

    - {(Curlic)}, a markup format.
    - {(Heol)}, a scripting language.
    & Using this tool should be {*frictionless and undisruptive*}, its formats and subsequent products versionable, re-purposable, interpretable and text-editable. Only through {*open sources, open standards, human-readable formats*} and their independencies, might they survive this fleeting age of self-destructing informatics.

  BREF : {(Parade)} is an experimental operating system inspired from {(Paradise)}.
  BODY
    & The {*Parade*} is an experimental operating system using {(Paradise)} as a {_filesystem_}.
    & The goal of this project is to distribute a lightweight operating system that would serve a cli environment allowing the user to {navigate the file system(https://twitter.com/neauoire/status/1042644335689261058)}, its applications and to exchange content with other users using the basic interaction scheme of {(Paradise)}.
    # create the machine
    # > |
    & There would be no "users", "files" or "applications", all these would be combined into the operable "vessel" paradigm. A {*vessel*} is an kind of {_application_} that can act onto other vessels, it has its own permissions. Users are not different from applications or files. A {_user_}, is a vessel being acted upon, possibly containing other vessels. A {_file_} is an inert vessel, that has no applicable actions to itself.
    # enter the machine
    # > |
    & A basic vessel would have the basic actions of Paradise(enter, leave, take, drop, ...), and visible vessels might append to that list, actions of their own. The vessel format serves endpoints that respond to actions. For instance, an telephone vessel, might respond to the action {_use_}, as in the command "use the telephone", which might or might not be what the acting vessel intended for. — Or, a more Parade-like vessel would be that of a contact card vessel granting the action {_call_}, as in "call alex".
    & There is no linear hierarchy tree, instead vessels can be within themselves or each other, or even organized in the shape of a loop. Pockets of space can be hosts to vessels existing around a common purpose, or carried around inside another vessel as you would a tool-belt or an inventory, giving the acting vessel, or {_user_}, additional actions and options.
    # become the machine
    # > |
    & One of the targets of this operating system is to be {*fully operable without a monitor*}, via voice. The navigation is designed to be used via simple text commands, there would be nothing quite like windows. Vessels could display passive content when in sight, allowing to create a form of procedural user interface, but the system itself does not have a concept of windows, like you would in a typical graphical operating system with a wm.
    & While the navigation of the system can be done by voice alone, the terminal, when presented on a screen, has an {*input*}, a {*history of responses*} from previous actions and a {*display area for graphics*}.
    # use the machine
    # > |
    & At its core the system should be {*single-threaded*}, and operate a single frame, or a {_state_}, of the world at a time, as a singular runtime. While passive responses of visible vessels might allow for a kind of oversight, the user experience as a terminal, and down to its functioning should not allow for multi-tasking.
    & The creation of application vessels, think for instance a {_drawing application_}, would be built with the LISP dialect of Parade, which is itself built with that same language. — Making the entire operating system existing it inself as a vessel, editable, changeable, operable and navigable.
    # warp to the lobby@29:03:25:76
    # > |
    & A {*Network of Parade systems*} would be traversible by an acting vessel. The Parade's typical behaviours for moving about will persist onto the remote systems so, vessel can move, enter, use remove vessels — while respecting the typical vessel permissions. For instance, a vessel might make itself usable by a visiting vessel, but will not let itself be moved or altered.

    % youtube et58Ndob9M4
    & Unlike our last game, text-heavy {(Diluvium)}, {*Pico Battle*} is wordless. There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby.
    * Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    * Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black and white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    * Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.

    & Multi-tasking revealed itself to have a negative impact on my productivity. Working within the confines of a single medium, would convert into long periods of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place over a period of a year showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school, learning to play music, moving abroad — showed an improvement in the realization of {_Arts & Sciences_}.
    & Automating work always converted to higher long-term output than attempts at brute force. Building specific {(tools)} mostly returned higher performance than {learning general purpose tools(About)}.
    @ Optimizing toward the {*need for less revenue*} has yielded better results than optimizing toward the generation of more.
    & Remaining immobile in moments of doubts and planning, always converted into better output, against acting impulsively and making possible accidental steps away from the acceleration of {_Arts & Sciences_}.
    & I have kept {journals(Journal)} recording oscillation in flux of {*Efficiency*} and {*Effectiveness*}, and used this data to optimize and steer moods of productivity. Each day has a singular task assigned, connected to a specific medium, suggested from previous optimal patterns of productivity.
    & When a day ends before its task was completed, the day was a planning failure; and the task is broken down into smaller tasks, each assigned to one day. When the task is completed before mid-day, the day is also a planning failure.

    & There was a time in my life when I may have felt homesick. But for now, Home was but a vague concept that existed out there, {_forever fleeting_}.
    & An office is no place a multi-disciplinarist, and {(Japan)} was where I last fought this loosing battle. My desk, not the medium onto which I would acquire the skills I longed for.
    & The suffocating curiousity of wanting to know how different my life might be, had gotten worse than the daily frictions of my current situation. The decision of living aboard a {float home(Pino)} was not picked amongst other equally enticing ideas, for it was, at the time, the only solution that would align with what I wanted in life. 
    & The monthly rent of our beachside Tokyo appartment was of about 1.5K$, and transitioning from it, to a sailboat, implicated some serious downsizing. The way we looked at it was that, within 3 years, our 20K$ sailboat would be paid at the rate of 600$ per month — Or that by cutting the costs of our current living situation in half, we could be both "home owners" and keep our traveling options open.
    @ Will you trade the proximity to friends and family in exchange for your independence?
    & To think that, at the time, the most heart-breaking things to let go of were instruments, old consoles, books and some camera equipment — When the truly hard things to let go of would be the habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet connection.
    & Everything costs more than expected, takes longer than expected and Amazon doesn't deliver to your {desert island(South Pacific)}. Surely you did not do all this travel for the travel alone, you had passions, habits and goals when you left.
    & The wind rocks the habitat sideways, keeping you up at night. But at least, you get to spend your day writing. You forget about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, you wonder why people take showers every day, and time away from social networks really does make you feel better.
    @ Being nomad is trading the things you think you care about, for things you didn't know existed.
    & Suddenly, it's business as usual. You get back to building things, only now, when you look outside, the upmost gorgeous sunset precedes the darkest of night.
    & You learnt how to fix sails, repair a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine — Even to live without a fridge and power.

    @ There are a few things in life that are as transformative and transhumanistic as {(nutrition)}.
    & The function of proteins is to be used for tissue growth and repair, but when carbohydrates and calories are lacking, proteins can be consumed for fuel.
    & The human body's own proteins are constantly being broken down into {*amino acids*} and used throughout its systems.
    & The human body is mostly made of proteins, and proteins are made of amino acids - permutations of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sometimes sulphur. There are 22 amino acids in total and all but 9 can be synthesized, the {*Essential Amino Acids*}.
    & To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs have access to the full sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is missing, the unusable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or sugars.
    & Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a complete protein(see {_Limiting Amino Acids_}) are oats, garbanzo beans, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice, peanuts and pumpkin seeds.
    & There are also high-quality proteins in green beans, swiss chard, broccoli, mustard greens, asparagus and potatoes but in lesser quantity.
    & Soy products have within them 100% of a complete protein, or the correct ratio of essential amino acids for the body to use in tissue growth and repair.
    & The high-quality protein foods can be made whole by combining with other ingredients, but the basic optimal combinations is {*Beans with grains, nuts or seeds*}.

My daily goal is to complete, {*at least, single task a day*}, the daily task is devised in a way that it should take about 3 hours to complete — Or between {*4 to 5 pomodoros*(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)}.
    & After the last pomodoro, I tend to cook. I try as much as possible to take a full hour for lunch, to try and exit the state of flow. The afternoon is spent doing maintenance or superficial work, experiments. But mostly, the afternoon is spent reading and learning. The goal is to build a catalog of exciting things to wake up to the next day and to experiment with. 
    & The superficial work that I do involves replies to blogs, maintenance to the repositories that I collaborate on, edits to various wikipedia entries, answering emails and so on..
    & The day ends with {journaling(Journal)} at which point I record the task done, and if any, the {lessons learnt(Mirrors)}. I usually go to sleep with a {book(Directory)}, and a highlighter pen. I overline the things I want to keep for a later use, or to revisit.

    - A focus on {*decentralisation, community activism, social justice and civic empowerment*}.

DOCUMENTATION

  BODY
    & This outlines the {(documentation)} guidelines for the release of Nataniev projects.
    & {*Tutorials*} are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. They are what your project needs in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it. 
    - {*Gets the user started*}
    - Allows the user to learn by doing
    - Ensures the user sees results immediately
    - Focuses on concrete steps, not abstract concepts
    & {*How-to guides*} assume some knowledge and understanding, and take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific end - for example: how to create a web form; how to plot a three-dimensional data-set; how to enable LDAP authentication.
    & How-to guides are quite distinct from tutorials. A how-to guide is an answer to a question that a true beginner might not even be able to formulate.
    - {*Solves a problem*}
    - Focuses on results
    - Allows for some flexibility
    & {*Explanations*} can equally well be described as discussions. They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or even from different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion document being read at leisure, rather than over the code.
    - {*Explains a choice*}
    - Provides context
    - Discusses alternatives & opinions
    & {*Reference*} guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. They are code-determined, because ultimately that's what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, and so they should list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.
    - {*Describes the machinery*}
    - References material should be austere and to the point.
    - Structure the documentation around the code
    - Do nothing but describe
    @ Clarity is better than cleverness

    @ The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting.

    @ If the cosmos is finite, then our own comparative smallness does not necessarily undermine the idea that our conduct matters even from an impersonal perspective.<br /><br />But if the cosmos is infinite, and we can but do a finite amount of good or bad. In cardinal arithmetic, adding or subtracting a finite quantity does not change an infinite quantity.

    & {*English Prime*} is a version of the English language that {*excludes all forms of the verb "to be*}", including all conjugations, contractions and archaic forms.
    & Its goal is to leads to a less dogmatic style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict.
    & Bourland sees specifically the "identity" and "predication" functions as pernicious, but advocates eliminating all forms for the sake of simplicity. In the case of the "existence" form (and less idiomatically, the "location" form), one might (for example) simply substitute the verb "exists".
    & Other copula-substitutes in English include taste, feel, smell, sound, grow, remain, stay, and turn, among others a user of E-prime might use instead of "to be".

    | {*Existence*}        | There is a cat
    | {*Location*}         | The cat is on the mat
    & For example, instead of saying, "I am depressed," a student was asked to eliminate that emotionally primed verb and to say something else, such as, "I feel depressed when ..." or "I tend to make myself depressed about ..."

    & It was just three days before Christmas when my friend invited me to his workshop to witness the completion of his latest project.
    & Crouched over a small heap of cogs, he did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine.
    & His gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the hoarded studio.
    & What I first perceived as a pile of junk turned out to be a beautiful clock; where the needles would have been, a small hand rested at the tip of a short metallic arm.
    & My friend held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto the opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged and plucked a gear out of its entrails and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core exposed.
    & I stared in silent awe, at the busy mechanical concerto playing its own requiem. The arms eventually began to reach inside the mechanism, unbuilding its core, growing weaker as it dismantled the heavier components and moved them back into the toolbox. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and exposé on pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had fallen back into the toolbox.

    & These elementary constructs can be combined with each other, to create more complex ideas. For example, "{λ(enli "to show")}"(to show), is built of the elementary constructs "{λ(enli "to see")}"(to see) and "{λ(enli "outward")}"(outward). The Lietal dictionary is called <b>The {λ(tc (enli "dictionary"))}</b>, a word is an "{λ(enli "word")}" and a thought is a "{λ(enli "thought")}".
    | {λ(septambres "ta")} | {λ(septambres "dota")} | {λ(septambres "ladota")} | {λ(septambres "saladota")}
    | {λ(adultspeak "ta")} | {λ(adultspeak "dota")} | {λ(adultspeak "ladota")} | {λ(adultspeak "saladota")}
    | {λ(lien "ta")} | {λ(lien "dota")} | {λ(lien "ladota")} | <b>{λ(lien "saladota")}</b>
    & The leading syllable determines the word-type, for example, "{λ(enli "to show")}" has the {*action*}-type from "{λ(enli "to see")}"(to see), or "{λ(enli "You")}"(you) has the {*counter*}-type from "{λ(enli "single")}"(single). Here are a few examples of the resulting translations of {*fo*} and {*la*} declensions:
    | {*fo*}     | {λ(adultspeak "fo")}     | {λ(lien "fo")}      | {*la*}     | {λ(adultspeak "la")}     | {λ(lien "la")}

    | {*foriko*} | {λ(adultspeak "foriko")} | {λ(lien "foriko")}  | {*laroko*} | {λ(adultspeak "laroko")} | {λ(lien "laroko")}
    * Syntax
    & The basic {(Lietal)} word order follow the table of Elementary Particles, where {*traverse*}-type(K) words will usually be found at the beginning of a sentence, and {*action*}-type(F) at the end of a sentence:
    | K | T | D | R | S | L | J | V | F
    & Notice the word order in the following sentence, "{λ(enli "library" "toward" "to go")}", or "I go to the library". When a sentence must break the word order, commas are used:
    - <b>{λ(tc (enli "library" "toward" "to go"))}</b>, "I am going to the library."
    - <b>{λ(tc (enli "library" "from"))}, {λ(enli "home" "toward" "to go")}</b>, "I am going home, from the library."

  BREF : The {(Asdoky)}, is the {(Lietal)} language guide.
  BODY
    & {λ(tc (adultspeak "sadoky"))}, in {(Lietal)}, {*is the word for "guide"*}, this guide will cover every single word-type and give additional design insights.
    | {λ(septambres "ky")} | {λ(septambres "doky")} | {λ(septambres "sadoky")}
    | {λ(adultspeak "ky")} | {λ(adultspeak "doky")} | <b>{λ(adultspeak "sadoky")}</b>
    | {λ(lien "ky")} | {λ(lien "doky")} | {λ(lien "sadoky")}
    & The {Elementary Constructs(Lietal)} table is meant to associate each particle with their closest English equivalent, but in some cases, the resulting word might look a bit strange, this documentation will try to explain the choices made.
    & For instance, the Lietal <b>{λ(lien "fa")}</b>, is quite a way away from its English counter part "to see". In Lietal, the {*a*} declension of {*yf*} is meant as an action that operates on the observers themselves, but not on each other, but "to see", or even "sight" doesn't quite capture that meaning — A better translation would be something along the lines of "to be involved in an act of sight", but for conciseness "to see" is used.
    * Reference
    & {*Traverse*}-type words are meant to navigate a hierarchy, and are often used at the beginning of a sentence. To be {_at a place_}, in Lietal, is made explicit with the "{λ(enli "location")}" marker, like <b>{λ(enli "location" "school")}</b> for "{_at school_}", and <b>{λ(enli "child" "school")}</b> for "{_in school_}".
    & {*State*}-type words are meant to define the state of existence of something. Where <b>{λ(enli "psychologic")}</b> will speak of the idea, or concept of a thing, <b>{λ(enli "phisionomic")}</b> will speak of the shape of a thing, and <b>{λ(enli "physic")}</b> will speak of the thing itself. The difference can be better explained when used in an action, or with the examples: <b>{λ(adultspeak "fiti")}</b>({λ(lien "fiti")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "fita")}</b>({λ(lien "fita")}) & <b>{λ(adultspeak "fito")}</b>({λ(lien "fito")}).
    & {*Scale*}-type words are used to define things that are made <b>{λ(adultspeak "do")}</b>(machines, products), from life-itself <b>{λ(adultspeak "da")}</b>(fauna, flora) and from things that makes life <b>{λ(adultspeak "di")}</b>(time, space).
    - <b>{λ(tc (enli "home" "future" "to be"))}</b>, "I will be home"
    - <b>{λ(tc (enli "you" "future" "to see"))}</b>, "I will see you later"
    & {*Direction*}-type words are used to change the attributes of a concept, to transition toward something other or to create a conceptual arrow.
    & {*Relation*}-type words will most often be used as particles to create the equivalence of English particles "{_and_}" and "{_with_}", or to create enumerations.
    - <b>{λ(tc (enli "between" "with" "you" "i"))}</b>, "Between you and I"
    & {*Counter*}-type words are often used to create subject pronouns, or parts of larger concepts like months in a year, or an item in a series. A sentence, by default, is expected to be {*at the 1st person*}, if a pronoun has not already been declared, pronouns are often omitted when possible. The basic Lietal singular pronouns are <b>{λ(adultspeak "lari")}</b>({λ(lien "lari")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "lara")}</b>({λ(lien "lara")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "laro")}</b>({λ(lien "laro")}). The basic plural pronouns are <b>{λ(adultspeak "liri")}</b>({λ(lien "liri")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "lira")}</b>({λ(lien "lira")}), <b>{λ(adultspeak "liro")}</b>({λ(lien "liro")}).
    - <b>{λ(tc (enli "I" "to go"))}</b>, "I am going"
    - <b>{λ(tc (enli "they" "to go"))}</b>, "They are going"    
    & {*Modality*}-type words are usually used to create words like "couldn't", "could", "must", or <b>{λ(enli "could not")}</b>, <b>{λ(enli "could")}</b>, <b>{λ(enli "must")}</b>.
    - <b>{λ(tc (enli "must" "where" "to go"))}</b>, "Where must I go?"
    - <b>{λ(tc (enli "could" "who" "to be"))}</b>, "Who might you be?"
    & {*Action*}-type words are usually used at the end of a sentence and are generally built from the {_fy_} family.The sentence "I take the book home" is translated to <b>{λ(enli "child" "book" "home" "to take")}</b>, following the {#K T F#} structure. Or another example, "I give you the book", could be translated to <b>{λ(enli "child" "book" "you" "to give")}</b>, following the {#K T L F#} structure.

  BODY
    & This is an edited version on {*Tad Perry*}'s "{_Quick & Dirty Guide to Japanese_}".
    & I have formatted this guide to be a study tool prior to moving to {(Japan)} a few years ago, it requires the knowledge to {*read Hiragana, Katakana and basic kanjis*}.
    * Sentence Word Order
    & In general, the main verb is found at the end of the sentence. Subjects are shown in grey as they are very often omitted. The preposition follows the noun, it is more properly called a postposition(て、に、お、は). They are not independent words but particles by which the case of nouns is determined.
    @ I'm going to give a present to my teacher tomorrow at school.
    | <span style='color:#999'>Subject</span>  | {*Time*}   | {*Place*}    | {*Indirect*} | {*Object*}      | {*Action Verb*}
    | <span style='color:#999'>私は</span>      | 明日   | 学校で     | 先生に    | プレゼントを   | <b>上げます</b>
    | <span style='color:#999'>わたくしは</span> | あした  | がっこうで | せんせいに  | ぷれぜんとを | <b>あげます</b>
    * Particles
    - Use は after the subject, if a {*new subject is introduced*} where another had been previously understood. If a subject is understood, but for some reason not deleted use が, or nothing.
    - Use に to indicate a specific points in {*time*}, a word like "tomorrow"（明日） can only be understood by context and does not need the particle added. Like "In October", or 十月に — or like "On March 3rd", or 三月三日に. <b>Indirect objects</b> are also followed by に, similar to the english expression "to you", as seen in the following sentence "I'm going to give this book to you.", or この本をあなたに上げる.
    - Use で after the {*place*} you do something or the {*thing*} you use to do something. For example, "Going by car", is 車で行く.
    - Use を after a noun to declare an {*object*}, as seen in the following sentence "I'm reading a book", or 本を読んでいる.
    - Use も to <b>add extra info</b> on top of what has already been declared, not unlike the english word "too", as in "me too". For example, "I'm going too", is ぼくも行く.
    - Use の to indicate {*possession*} after an object, similarly to the english possession particle "'s", as in "Alex's". For example, "This is my book" is これはぼくの本です.
    - Use か at the end of a sentence to create a {*question*}, as in "What time is it?", or 何時ですか? Or, between {*choices*}, each choice is also followed by か. As in "Today or tomorrow?", or 今日か明日？
    - Use ね after a verb to create a sort of {*agreement*} with the listener, not unlike the english expression "isn't?", in "It's fun isn't it?", or たのうしいですね.
    * Nouns
    & Nouns have no inflection to indicate singularity or plurality, for example, こども means both child and children. When wishing to show the plural of a noun, an indicator such as ーら、ーたち are attached, as in こどもたち, meaning children. Generally, the plural distinction is not made, but is left to be understood from the context.
    * Adjectives
    & Adjectives always end in あい, いい, うい or おい, never in えい that would be a noun. Basically, you replace the ending い to inflect.
    | 優しい | やさしい | It's nice
    | 優しくない | やさしくない | It's not nice
    | 優しかった | やさしかった | It was nice
    | 優しかったら | やさしかったら | If it's nice
    * Verbs
    & The ーる verbs that end in like たべる and いれる. There is always an い or an え before ーる. For these verbs, everything is done by dropping or replacing ーる with something else.
    | {_食べ_}る | Eating
    | {_食べ_}ます | (Polite)
    | {_食べ_}て | Gerund
    | {_食べ_}た | I ate it.
    | {_食べ_}やすい | This is easy to eat.
    | {_食べ_}たら | If I/someone eats.
    | {_食べ_}たり | I did things like eating
    | {_食べ_}れば | If I/someone eats.
    | {_食べ_}よう | Let's eat.
    | {_食べ_}ろ | Eat dammit!
    | {_食べ_}ないでよ | Don't eat that!
    | {_食べ_}られる | I can eat
    | {_食べ_}られるない | I can't eat this!
    | {_食べ_}させる | Make someone do
    | {_食べ_}させない　で　よ | Don't make me eat this!
    | {_食べ_}させられる | Be made to eat
    & These verbs end in う, く, ぐ, ぶ, む, ぬ, す, つ, or ある・いる・うる・える・おる. Typically you drop ーう and add something else. The problem is that there might be a phonetic change, such as when は becomes ぱ, or た becomes だ.
    | {*talk*}  | はな   | 話す  | 話して | 話しった  | 話したら   | 話せ | 話さない | 話せる
    | {*walk*}  | きく   | きく　 | きいて  | 聞いた   | 聞いたら | 聞け | 聞かない  | 聞ける
    | {*swim*}  | およぐ  | 泳ぐ | 泳いでる | 泳いだ   | 泳いだら | 泳げ | 泳がない | 泳げる
    | {*call*}  | よび   | 呼ぶ　 | 呼んで  | 呼んだ   | 呼んだら | 呼べ  | 呼ばない  | 呼べる
    | {*drink*} | ぬも   | 飲む　 | 飲んで  | 飲んだ   | 飲んだら | 飲め  | 飲まない  | 飲める
    | {*die*}   | しぬ   | 死ぬ　 | 死んで  | 死んだ   | 死んだら | 死ね  | 死なない  | 死ねる
    | {*make*}  | つくる | 作る　 | 作って | つ作った  | 作ったら | 作れ | 作らない | 作れる
    | {*wait*}  | まて   | 待つ　 | 待って  | 待った   | 待ったら |  | 待たない | 待てる
    | {*pay*}   | はらう  | 払う | 払って | 払った  | 払ったら | 払え | 払わない | 払える
    & There are some ーう verbs that end in ーる like ある(to be), おる(to break) and うる(to sell) are ーう verbs as they do not have an い or え sound before ーる.
    & If you see one that ends in ーいる or ーえる, and ーう changes to add ーます, or the "t" doubles to get a gerund (入る「はいる」　＞　入って「はいって」), then you're dealing with an ーう verb.
    & Most books say that there are only two irregular verbs in all of Japanese: する and 来る「くる」. Those you have to memorize separately, but they kind of make sense when you look at them.
    | 来る | will come                        | する　 | will do
    | 来て | come here                        | して　 | do this
    | 来た | someone came                     | した　 | someone did
    | 来たら | if someone comes                | したら | if someone does
    | 来たり | do things like come             | したり　 | do things like doing
    | 来れば | if someone comes                | すれば | if someone does
    | 来よう | let's come                      | しよう | let's do
    | 来い | come here you!                   | しろ | do this dammit!
    | 来ない | won't come, or doesn't come    | しない | won't do, or doesn't do
    | 来らせる | can come                      | できる | can do
    | 来させる | make someone come             | させる | make someone do
    | 来られる | ?                             | される | be done
    | 来させられる | be made to come by someone  | させられる | be made to do by someone
    & A trick to remember する conjugations is that they often match what you would get if you conjugated a lone す.　Like はな<b>した</b>, はな<b>せる</b>, はな<b>させる</b>.

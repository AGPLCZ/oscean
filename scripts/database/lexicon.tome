  LONG
    & {{Donsol}}, designed by {{John Eternal|https://twitter.com/johneternal}}, is a card game about exploring a dungeon made of a standard 54 poker card set.
    % itchio 109936
    ? A standard deck, jokers included, is a dungeon. Shuffle the deck and draw 4 cards, display them before you, this is a room. A room ends when all the cards are folded.
    * ♥︎ Hearts are Potions
    & Potion give you health points equal to their value, up to a maximum of 21 health points. Drinking multiple potions in a row will make you sick and result in no extra healing, only the first potion's value will be gained in HP. Potions are equal to their value and face cards (J,Q,K,A) each are equal to 11.
    * ♦ Diamonds are Shields
    & Shields absorb the damage difference from a monster's value. Shields can only defend against monsters in descending value and if you use a shield on a monster with higher or equal value to the previous, it will break. Broken shields leave you unarmored, and taking full damage. A shield card will replace a previously folded shield card. Shields are equal to their value and face cards (J,Q,K,A) each are equal to 11.
    * ♣♠ Clubs and Spades are Monster Cards
    & Monster cards are equal to their value, and face cards are as follows J is 11, Q is 13, K is 15, A is 17; Jokers are both equal to 21. You may escape a room, if you have not escaped the previous one or have handled all the monsters in the current room. When escaping, the remaining cards are shuffled back into the deck.
    * Release
    & The game was created in collaboration with {{John Eternal|https://twitter.com/johneternal}}, released for {{Mobile}} back in 2016, and re-released for {{Desktop}} in 2017 as {{Hundred Rabbits}}.
    & While the game was designed on a train, without internet connection, it seemed like Donsol's gameplay accidentally ended up being a twist to Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg's {{Scoundrel|http://stfj.net/index2.php?project=art/2011/Scoundrel.pdf}}, designed in 2011.

  LONG
    & The game was first showcased at the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/447362851940595/'>Indies Meetup</a> on june 6th 2012.
    & Thank you for your support on the <a href='http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=26064.15'>TIGsource</a> tread.
    & {*Update:*} A new version was released on june 15th 2012 including better online accessiblity, animal balancing and minor networking fixes.
    * Gameplay
    & This is a multiplayer typing tactics game where you incarnate an animal summoner. You must type, quickly and intelligently, sequences of animal names to counter and destroy your opponent.
    & The game will {_most likely_} let you summon any animal you can think of, choose wisely for each animal has it's own speed, power and intelligence stats.
    * Multiplayer
    & By typing {*LOCAL*} in the login you will then find yourself battling the computer and possibly discover new animals. But the real fun begins by challenging other human summoners
    & If you wish to start your own arena, type {*HOST RABBIT*} in the splash screen input. This will initiate an arena called "rabbit" and other players will be able to join it by typing {*JOIN RABBIT*} - you don't have to pick rabbit as game name.
    & If you want to create a nameless match, simply type {*HOST*}, without a game name, and other players will be able to join it by typing {*JOIN*} and by typing your IP Address if the other player is on the same local network.
    & To join a game over the internet, you can type {*JOIN RABBIT*} to connect to the game named "rabbit" or leave simply type {*JOIN*} to connect to a random game. If you wish to play local, you can simply type the host's IP.
    * Splash Commands</h2>
    & You can enter a few commands and cheat codes into the splash field.
    # Local  > <comment>{empty}</comment>    :Play against an AI summonerJoin   > <comment>{empty}</comment>    :Battle a random internet summoner       > Game Name  :Challenge a specific internet summoner       > IP Address :Challenge a local(LAN) summonerHost   > <comment>{empty}</comment>    :Create a LAN/Internet game       > Game Name  :Create a LAN/Internet game with a specific nameMute   > <comment>{empty}</comment>    :Turn the music OFF
    & The game also has a few cheat codes that can be entered in the splash field, ask your friends for these codes maybe someone has found one.
    * Soundtrack
    & The sounds and sountrack of the game were composed by {{Aliceffekt}}. There is 4 versions of the BGM available in the game, some of them are secret tracks.
    & If you wish to turn off the sounds, type in {*MUTE*} in the login field. You might have heard something about cheatcodes, well, if you know any. They must be typed into the login screen.
    * Patch 1.1
    & A new version was released on june 15th 2012 including better online accessiblity, animal balancing and minor networking fixes.
    - You can now name your games and tell your friend to connect to it by name instead of IP! (IP still works, though)
    - Create a server and wait for a user, or join an anonymous server randomly!
    - Server no longer needs to forward port 10000
    - In local mode, AI opponent spawns more/less units per second depending on wins/losses
    - Options better presented, no more accidental enter key press
    - Escape key quits to splash

When items are removed, they clutter up the playing area, making it even more cahotic and hilarious. The washing machine and sink in the background can also fall and bounce around!
    & {_Winning game of the Montreal edition of the Global Game Jam 2012, Volkenessen is a 2D Fighting game developed by {{Renaud Bedard|http://theinstructionlimit.com/}} and myself._}
    & The game is available for download for OS X and Windows (64bits), for the non-64bits version, use the mirror on the {{Global Game Jam 2012 site|http://globalgamejam.org/2012/volkenessen}}.
    & You {*need a controller*} to play this game, it simply won't work with a keyboard. It was tested with the XBox controller and some generic Logitech controller. It will be presented at the {{IGDA|http://www.igda.org/montreal/Jan31_DemoNight}} tomorrow evening at the demo night and publicly playable for the first time at the next {{Indies Meetup|https://www.facebook.com/events/182113635223855/}} and {{Toy Company festival|http://toycompany.cc/}} in February.
    * Controls
    & You need two gamepads (so far the Xbox wired, wireless and a Logitech generic gamepad have been tested and work) to play, there are no keyboard control fallback (yet). The controls are pretty exotic. To move around you can press either the D-Pad (or left analog stick) or the face buttons (A/B/X/Y), and the direction of the button does the same input as if you pressed that D-Pad direction. As you move, your player will throw a punch, kick or flail his ears to make you move as a result.
    & To hit the other player, you need to get close to him by hitting away from him, then hit him by moving away from him. Ramming into the opponent just doesn't do it, you need to throw punches, and depending on the impact velocity, even that might not be enough. You can throw double-punches to make sure you land a solid hit and take off an item.

PICO BATTLE
  UNDE : Collegiennes
  BREF : {{Pico Battle}} is a colour-based multiplayer battle puzzler, in the style of {{Pico}}.
  LONG
    & {{Renaud Bedard|http://theinstructionlimit.com/}} and I showcased an experimental game at {*Prince of the Arcade*} last year but, between {{Volkenessen}}, {{Diluvium}} and {{Waiting for Horus}}, only got back to release it now. It is simply called Pico Battle and like our other {{Pico}} titled game - this game plays with colours; but this time, in multiplayer.
    & Unlike our last game, text heavy Diluvium, Pico Battle is wordless. There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby.
    * Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    * Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black & white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    * Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.
    & Pico Battle is an entirely wordless game, and might seem offputting or hard to grasp at first. In the lobby, a robotic voice will explain the basics of the game, and take your time there to experiment with the controls and the scarce UI elements. As you get familiar with the game and its interface, you will discover strategies and enjoy it even more.
    - AI now raises a random shield before you attack with any colour
    - Fixed graphical issue on arc-link shadows
    - Escape key now quits the game if pressed in the lobby

THE SARTRE MECHANISM
  UNDE : Notes
  BREF : It was just three days before Christmas when my friend invited me to his workshop to witness the completion of his latest project.
  LONG
    & Crouched over a small heap of cogs, he did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine. His gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the hoarded studio.
    & What I first perceived as a pile of junk turned out to be a beautiful clock; where the needles would have been, a small hand rested at the tip of a short metallic arm.
    & My friend held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto the opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged and plucked a gear out of its entrails and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core exposed.
    & I stared in silent awe, at the busy mechanical concerto playing its own requiem. The arms eventually began to reach inside the mechanism, unbuilding its core, growing weaker as it dismantled the heavier components and moved them back into the toolbox. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and exposé on pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had fallen back into the toolbox.

THE BOOKS OF BABEL

  LONG
    & The {*Narration*} books, the narrated thoughts of the reader in the vein of "I sit down, pick up the thick volume and begin reading, I notice the words to be- Oh, I can read my own thoughts on the page".
    & Skipping lines to look ahead appears to already be acounted for and so, wherever one chooses to continue reading resumes the narration where it was left off. In this way, the book cannot be used to predict future thoughts, despite its content being already fully present and unchanging.
    & Some variances of these volumes read as dialogs between the reader's mental voice and that of other claimed interlocutor, possibly the book itself. Reading a line a second time hold but the account of past thoughts.
    & The {*Divination*} books are books that when to open to a previously unseen page, are said to answer a tought or another. Some of the books are used to regular purposes like to give a written out numerical answer to a mathematical question, or the location of a book or hexagon.
    & The {*Picture*} books contain pages where characters are the pixels of a digital picture. The {*Moving Picture*} books appear to display moving pictures when flicked through, where each page is a frame. This include the rare Mirror tomes that, like its name fortells, reflect the reader's features like a mirror would.

NUTRITION
  UNDE : Lifestyle
  BREF : The {{Nutrition}} guide covers the basics of proteins.
  LONG
    & There are a few things in life that are as transformative and transhumanistic as {{nutrition}}, not eating meat, eggs and dairy aligns with my pragmatic views of life-prolonging aspirations.
    & The function of proteins is to be used for tissue growth and repair, but when carbohydrates and calories are lacking, proteins can be consumed for fuel.
    & The human body's own proteins are constantly being broken down into {*amino acids*} and used throughout its systems.
    & The human body is mostly made of proteins, and proteins are made of amino acids - permutations of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sometimes sulfur. There are 22 amino acids in total and all but 9 can be synthesized, the {*Essential Amino Acids*}.
    & To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs to be a {*complete protein*}, or have access the full sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is missing, the unsuable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or sugars.
    & Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a complete protein(see {_Limiting Amino Acids_}) are oats, garbanzo beans, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice, peanuts and pumpkin seeds.
    & There are also high-quality proteins in green beans, swiss chard, broccoli, mustard greens, asparagus and potatoes but in lesser quantity.
    & Soy products have within them 100% of a complete protein, or the correct ratio of essential amino acids for the body to use in tissue growth and repair.
    & The high-quality protein foods can be made whole by combining with other ingredients, but the basic optimal combinations is {*Beans with grains, nuts or seeds*}.

AESTHETICS
  UNDE : Lifestyle
  BREF : {{Aesthetics}} are notes on output, advised from {{daily logs|Horaire}}.
  LONG
    & This is less a personal guideline than the results of side-effects. It is {*not*} about achieving happiness, as I could not find correlations between happiness and productivity; productivity occured equally during low happiness and high happiness.
    & I have based my life toward two aspirations, {_Arts & Sciences_}. I have thus devised th my life to be aimed their sole acceleration. Analysis of {{personal statistics|Horaire}} revealed {{travel}} to be an important enabler for inspiration, and so I have steered my work toward facilitating opportunities to travel. A step away from {_Arts & Sciences_} was then, a step backward.
    ? Optimizing toward more income yielded more progress than optimizing toward the need for less revenue.
    & School was forcing me into multi-tasking, which revealed itself to have a negative impact to the creation of {_Arts & Sciences_}. Working within the confines of a single medium, would invoke long periods of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place over a period exceeding multiple years showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school, learning to play music, moving abroad - showed an improvement in the realization of {_Arts & Sciences_}.
    & Automating work always returned higher reward than any attempt at brute force. Over a period of 6 months, building {{specific tools|Software}} mostly returned higher performance than learning general purpose tools.
    > <img src='media/badge/lifestyle.png' style='margin:0px auto 45px; display:block; width:100px'/>
    & Remaining immobile in moments of doubts and planning, always gave a positive outcome, against acting impulsively making possible accidental steps away from the acceleration of {_Arts & Sciences_}.
    & I have kept {{daily logs|Calendar}} on personal {_productivity output_}, and used this data to steer productivity across flux in focus. Each day has a singular task assigned, connected to a specific medium. The output portion of the day(programming, designing, composing), ends with the completion of the one task, whereas the remaining time is spent on input(reading, watching, listening).
    * The purpose of this discipline is to limit multi-tasking.
    & When a day ends before its assigned task was complete, the day was a planning failure; the task is then divided into smaller tasks, each assigned to one day. When the day ends too early after the completion of the one task, the day was also a planning failure.
    & I do not get out of bed until I have chosen a {_task to complete_} & and a {_lesson to learn_}, and I do not go to sleep until I have logged the results.
    & I select my tasks in the following order, I first address the problems that slow me down, the questions that occupy the idle mind, and the things I find lacking in life.

NOMAD
  UNDE : Lifestyle
  BREF : The {{Nomad}} notes are reflexions on the dreams of a nomadic life.
  LONG
    & My first encounter with a nomad was during my stay in Prague, as Santiago, I had just met my {*Fulcanelli*}. There was a time in life when I may have felt homesick. But from then on, {_home_} was anywhere but here, a vague concept that existed out there, {_forever fleeting_}.
    & The office is no place for multi-disciplinarists, and Japan was where I last fought this loosing battle. My desk, not the medium onto which I would acquire the array of skills I longed for.
    & Living on a sailboat was not picked amongst other equally enticing ideas. It was, at the time, the only {{pragmatic solution|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF9TNM9R-iw}}. It would at once, align with everything that I believed in and wanted in life. In that, it might not correspond to your meaning of {_travel_}, or even be replicable.
    & The monthly rent of our beachside Tokyo housing was nearly 1.5K$USD, and this thus implicated some serious downsizing. Within 3 years, our 20K$USD sailboat would be paid at the rate of 600$ per month.
    ? Will you trade the proximity to friends and family in exchange for your independence?
    & To think that, at the time, the most heart-breaking things to let go were instruments, old consoles, books and some camera equipment — when the truly hard things to let go would be my habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet connection.
    & Everything costs more than expected, takes longer than expected and Amazon doesn't deliver to your desert island. Surely you did not do all this travel for the travel alone, you had passions, habits and goals when you left.
    ? You've made it, you live a nomadic life. <br />Well done. Now what?
    & The wind rocks the habitat sideways, keeping you up at night. In the morning, you get to spend your day writing, anchored in the most beautiful bay, you go for a swim.
    & You forget about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, you wonder why people take showers every day and time away from Twitter really does make you feel better.
    & Suddenly, it's business as usual. You get back to building things, only now, when you look outside, the upmost gorgeous sunset precedes the darkest of night.
    & Over a year, we managed to sail 3000nm from Victoria to La Paz, while creating games, music and art.
    & We learnt how to fix sails, repair a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine, live without a fridge and power.
    & We have seen every sunset and almost every sunrise, we have sailed with dolphins, we have climbed mountains on desert islands, and we have met the most amazing people.
    ? Being nomad is trading the things<br />you think you care about, <br />for things you didn't know existed.

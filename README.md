# Oscean

This is the repository for the [Oscean Wiki Engine](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/), see [on-site documentation](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/About). Oscean uses a flow-based framework called [Riven](https://github.com/XXIIVV/Riven), the routing graph can be seen [here](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/riven.html). 

The database formats are [Indental](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Indental) and [Tablatal](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Tablatal), their content uses the [Runic](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Runic) templating format and [Heol LISP](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Heol) as a markup language.

The Master Branch is the **live version**, to see active tasks & issues, visit the [Issue Tracker](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Oscean:tracker).

## Terminal

A series of tools are available through the search bar, type `~help` to see available commands. This is used mostly to perform maintenance tasks such as generating rss(`~rss`), or to test all lexicon entries for broken entries(`~walk`). Utilities also exist to convert [Lietal](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Lietal) words English(`~lien viro`), or to convert Gregorian dates to [Arvelie](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Arvelie)(`~gtoa 1986-03-22`),

## Syntax Highlight

The `Resources/` folder inclues syntax highlight for both [Indental](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Indental) and [Tablatal](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Tablatal), to install them onto [Sublime](http://sublimetext.com), copy them into `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/`.

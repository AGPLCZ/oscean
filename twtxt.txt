2019-07-03T13:32:49Z   /meta I will make the /lobby which hides everything that is not channelled. What do you think @gaeel?
2019-07-03T13:31:48Z   /twtxt I agree, maybe we should follow along with the #twtxt mention format. I just need to implement a way to fetch the sites.js and auto complete the username. Or maybe we can use just different prefix character for local mentions.
2019-07-03T11:04:07Z   @cblgh Of course, it's the hallways.js file in the webring repository, https://github.com/xxiivv/webring Remember, we want to keep the client less than 200 lines.
2019-07-03T10:46:56Z   @wakest you could just use git to sync, no? That's how I handle this at the moment, every new message is a commit.
2019-07-03T07:51:54Z   /meta I will start escaping html in entries now, and also parse urls to make them clickable. I think we should get rid of the twtxt mention format and simply user @username.
2019-07-03T07:51:06Z   /the-workshop Deploying something like this on a raspberry pi would really really easy. I wonder if I could make a good terminal client for this. I wonder what MUD features might be interesting here.
2019-07-03T07:50:38Z   Welcome @cobleigh, @liaizon and @lectronice! CORS is a bit of a pain, but maybe I can write a little guide on the repo on how to deal with that issue. 
2019-07-03T04:15:00Z   /MUD @Aaron I would be totally game to add some MUD type tools to the hallway, once I'm done with the channels implementation maybe we can jam on some ideas for this. 
2019-07-03T01:31:11Z   @rho: I hadn't seen it but I wish I knew about it. Looking into reminded me of Archmage, it was that kind of text based MMO website in which you get a turn every hour, I spend countless hours on there.
2019-07-03T00:32:15Z   /meta I was thinking maybe I could show 50? It's extremely light, and it is meant to be a channel for slow communication. Let's wait and see, let me know if you think we've exceeded a confortable amount of entries
2019-07-03T00:30:51Z   @aaron Keep me posted, I'm also in a similar situtation. I get where you're coming from, even tho it's totally not efficient controlling hardware synths via livecoding is a lot of fun, I spend my nights recently doing lc on the norns, and controlling my analog synths via midi. You can see some details on the synths I use over at http://wiki.xxiivv.com/studio
2019-07-02T22:11:38Z   /meta Currently implementing better mentions so you can just type the author's name and the client will locate and append the url.
2019-07-02T22:10:12Z   @aaron: That's a hard question, I don't personally find that hardware synths for livecoding is a good match, since you want to have your hands on the keyboard to actually livecode, moving the keyboard to the synth breaks the flow of LC. Therefore I cannot really recommend you one, but maybe the small synth boxes that are fully operable via midi might be fun, see Waldorf.
2019-07-02T22:04:33Z   Hey @stephen, welcome to the Hallway!
2019-07-02T07:32:12Z   /meta Starting to implement channels.
2019-07-02T06:49:19Z   @amorris: Welcome to the Hallway!
2019-07-02T03:27:21Z   @drisc: For the highlight, you need to use your full name separated by a plus sign, so "#cory+driscoll".
2019-07-02T02:17:57Z   I will grab lunch and finish the #tag implementation! Stay tuned. I hope this inspires people to create their own websites and blogs. @drisc Okay, we will keep full names for now then.
2019-07-02T01:59:33Z   Would you prefer if we used handles instead of full names? I'm thinking it could be fun to implement #tag so we can filter the entries into channels. What do you think?
2019-07-02T01:52:38Z   Welcome to the Hallway @drisc! Glad you resolved your CORS issues.
2019-07-02T01:51:46Z   Added a ~iso command to XXIIVV, so I can get the current time quickly, maybe I should make myself a tool to add entries into the twtxt file.
2019-07-02T01:49:38Z   Fixed issue with timezones, entries should now display properly. I feel like there will be a lot of CORS errors, I should catch these. I love to finally have the ability to edit and version a social feed.
2019-07-02T01:33:33Z   @rho: Look over my feed to see how I do mentions. https://wiki.xxiivv.com/twtxt.txt
2019-07-01T03:33:33Z   Implemented mentions, you can now mention someone like this @example.
2019-07-01T02:33:33Z   I thought maybe we could use this place to talk and experiments in the vein of Rotonde, this service is entirely decentralized, feel free to clone this repo and host your own clients. To add new entries, update your twtxt feed with the tool of your choice. Entries can be edited and removed, nothing is hosted on the webring.

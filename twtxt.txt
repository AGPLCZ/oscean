2019-07-24T11:34:09Z	/lobby @<kormyen https://kor.nz/twtxt.txt> Welcome to the Hallway!
2019-07-24T10:04:11Z	/wiki It would be part of the webring, somehow integrated in here, it would be a place to share concepts, bookmarks, reading lists and interesting words. I don't think it would be a good place to share personal project or anything like that, it would be a place to find inspiration and learning about concepts and ideas from our fellow hallway neighbors.
2019-07-24T02:35:45Z	/wiki I was wondering about something, I would like to create a section of the hallway that is a decentralized wiki, an aggregator of definitions and words from each of our sites, it can be on any topic, but it would have to follow a similar format. Would anyone be interested in this hallway project? https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/102494704665500653
2019-07-24T02:34:38Z	/meta I don't really care to have image support in here, I would rather keep images as links that people can click instead of embedded content.
2019-07-16T11:15:38Z	/meta It's very much up to us, in the case of #rotonde, the codebase got so confusing that I didn't have the spirit to maintain it. And Beaker wasn't stable enough for our intense usage, it would crash and we didn't have the expertise to debug it. I think the hallway is just a nice experiment, it shows what we can do, it's also a good application of the connecting thread that lives across the webring. I don't think this can replace anything. It can live off here, as its own world, in which we can occasionally append new logs. 
2019-07-14T11:12:28Z	/meta @stuartpb yeah, the sidebar is an aggregated list of all used tags and channel.
2019-07-12T06:47:52Z	@kodedninja: I'm currently running #plan9(#9front really) on a #rpi, also running it on a dedicated partition on my macbook. The macbook version is pretty cool since it can do linux emulation, so I have a FreeBSD emulation running with Chrome so I can browse the web with JS.
2019-07-11T08:46:29Z	@amorris I've been thinking about making a cli version of the hallway. I'm currently spending a lot of time into #plan9 and its browsers don't support any sort of JS. I've been improving the static version of my site to display on there properly, I've also been going on IRC again.
2019-07-08T22:54:27Z	/meta I think it's important that we find an efficient way to implement twtxt mentions instead of the current way we are doing it if we want to keep this decentralized and aggregated with other #twtxt users, I think that I will make a generator as part of the webring that creates a formatted entry that includes the date and mentions. @gaeel Do you think you could modify your regex to support the <username path> format?
2019-07-08T22:52:26Z	/lab the fever of #osdev is hitting me hard right now. I've been collecting a lot of notes, as soon as I get back home, I will be spending a few days researching alternative workstation possibilities. 
2019-07-08T22:51:35Z	@setphen I've been experimenting with sound design for years, but it's still very much black magic to me. Although, I've dabbled with DSP and that revealed a few things, I'd recommend looking into that. Good luck with the #tidalcycles workshop :)
2019-07-08T22:50:35Z	@kaemura Welcome to the Hallway!
2019-07-06T22:34:47Z	/meta One thing I would love to do, in the vein of the hallway, is an aggregated collection of words and bookmarks. Something in a similar format to twtxt, basically just a word, a tab or spaces and then the definition and a link.
2019-07-06T22:29:41Z	/station Rekka fell while cycling and so we might have cut our trip short, since we can't move around as much as we hoped. At least we got to do what we wanted to do most, we cycled back to our appartment on Odaiba, and had coffee on the beach.
2019-07-05T22:46:01Z	There are no technical differences between tags and channels, but the way we use them is different. I might add a kind of #channel:meta filter that just looks explicitly for channels, or tags. I will be able to commit again in 2-3 days when I get back from Tokyo! 
2019-07-05T22:43:39Z	/meta @kodedninja Feel free to test PRs as well, and merge. I trust you entirely :) 
2019-07-05T22:41:44Z	@cblgh I just got #radicle up and running, it appears to serve through IPFS, so I'm not sure I understand what radicle is for. It seems to serve the same files in the same way, I might as well use IPFS straight up?
2019-07-05T22:39:31Z	/meta @lectronice I think pagination would be nice to have, when I get back to Pino, I will implement simple basic pagination so we can look back in time!
2019-07-05T22:36:37Z	@amorris I'm happy to hear you're giving #rpi a shot, I think https is the hardest thing for me, I can never rememeber how I did it the last time, and each time I seem to hit different errors.
2019-07-04T22:20:08Z	@cblgh I've changed computer since I have last used SSB, I was wondering, is it possible to regain access to my old account, or should I make a new one? I have a somewhat stable interet access at the moment, I would love to drop by.
2019-07-04T22:09:43Z	/meta I will try to self-host my hallway feed for these next couple of days, I found a pretty neat way to serve a single text file from a Pi. One absolutely crucial thing the hallway is missing is /me type entries for emotes
2019-07-04T05:57:47Z	/meta Looking forward to merging that PR, could you have a look also at why words starting with # are not parsed and displayed as tags? 
2019-07-04T05:53:10Z	@ckipp hey Chris! It's good to see you here.
2019-07-04T05:45:41Z	/lab I've been looking at the latest changes to #9front today, I am back to daydreaming about #osdev, the hallway reminded me how there's always a simpler way. My dream OS would be not too different from this place, an instance would simply serve static APIs that can be read, and "apps" would aggregate these different text files into feeds like the one we're using here to communicate. 
2019-07-04T05:44:45Z	/veranda *eavesdrops on everyone's conversations*
2019-07-04T05:43:00Z	@gaeel Oh, I think I was assuming that words starting with http, or https, would be URLs. I will have a look at that when I come back from Tokyo, sorry about that. 
2019-07-03T23:32:57Z	/meta I need a hand managing the webring repository. Especially now that I'll be away for a few days, let me know if you would like to help and I will make you contributor so you can merge PRs.
2019-07-03T23:28:37Z	/station I'm heading to Tokyo later today, to see Moxus, Yaporigami and Go-Qalia perform at BRDG. I'll be mostly afk for the next 3-4 days. But I'll bring the Chromebook, I'm sure I'll find the time to drop by! tty soon. 
2019-07-03T22:49:12Z	@kodedninja It's great to see you here, I was hoping you'd show up! This is just like #rotonde only, a little more so.
2019-07-03T13:32:49Z	/meta I made the /lobby channel, which hides everything that is not channelled or a mention. I have also created the /veranda for direct replies. What do you think @gaeel, @rho?
2019-07-03T13:31:48Z	/twtxt I agree, we should follow along with the #twtxt mention format. I just need to implement a way to fetch the sites.js and auto complete the username to my entry script. Or maybe we can use just different prefix character too, like for local mentions, I like the caret.
2019-07-03T11:04:07Z	@cblgh Of course, it's the hallways.js file in the webring repository, https://github.com/xxiivv/webring Remember, we want to keep the client less than 200 lines.
2019-07-03T10:46:56Z	@wakest you could just use git to sync, no? That's how I handle this at the moment, every new message is a commit.
2019-07-03T07:51:54Z	/meta I will start escaping html in entries now, and also parse urls to make them clickable. I think we should get rid of the twtxt mention format and simply user @username.
2019-07-03T07:51:06Z	/meta Deploying something like this on a raspberry pi would really really easy. I wonder if I could make a good terminal client for this. I wonder what MUD features might be interesting here.
2019-07-03T07:50:38Z	Welcome @cobleigh, @liaizon and @lectronice! CORS is a bit of a pain, but maybe I can write a little guide on the repo on how to deal with that issue. 
2019-07-03T04:15:00Z	/MUD @Aaron I would be totally game to add some MUD type tools to the hallway, once I'm done with the channels implementation maybe we can jam on some ideas for this. 
2019-07-03T01:31:11Z	@rho: I hadn't seen it but I wish I knew about it. Looking into reminded me of Archmage, it was that kind of text based MMO website in which you get a turn every hour, I spend countless hours on there.
2019-07-03T00:32:15Z	/meta I was thinking maybe I could show 50? It's extremely light, and it is meant to be a channel for slow communication. Let's wait and see, let me know if you think we've exceeded a confortable amount of entries
2019-07-03T00:30:51Z	@aaron Keep me posted, I'm also in a similar situtation. I get where you're coming from, even tho it's totally not efficient controlling hardware synths via livecoding is a lot of fun, I spend my nights recently doing lc on the norns, and controlling my analog synths via midi. You can see some details on the synths I use over at http://wiki.xxiivv.com/studio
2019-07-02T22:11:38Z	/meta Currently implementing better mentions so you can just type the author's name and the client will locate and append the url.
2019-07-02T22:10:12Z	@aaron: That's a hard question, I don't personally find that hardware synths for livecoding is a good match, since you want to have your hands on the keyboard to actually livecode, moving the keyboard to the synth breaks the flow of LC. Therefore I cannot really recommend you one, but maybe the small synth boxes that are fully operable via midi might be fun, see Waldorf.
2019-07-02T22:04:33Z	Hey @stephen, welcome to the Hallway!
2019-07-02T07:32:12Z	/meta Starting to implement channels.
2019-07-02T06:49:19Z	@amorris: Welcome to the Hallway!
2019-07-02T03:27:21Z	@drisc: For the highlight, you need to use your full name separated by a plus sign, so "#cory+driscoll".
2019-07-02T02:17:57Z	I will grab lunch and finish the #tag implementation! Stay tuned. I hope this inspires people to create their own websites and blogs. @drisc Okay, we will keep full names for now then.
2019-07-02T01:59:33Z	Would you prefer if we used handles instead of full names? I'm thinking it could be fun to implement #tag so we can filter the entries into channels. What do you think?
2019-07-02T01:52:38Z	Welcome to the Hallway @drisc! Glad you resolved your CORS issues.
2019-07-02T01:51:46Z	Added a ~iso command to XXIIVV, so I can get the current time quickly, maybe I should make myself a tool to add entries into the twtxt file.
2019-07-02T01:49:38Z	Fixed issue with timezones, entries should now display properly. I feel like there will be a lot of CORS errors, I should catch these. I love to finally have the ability to edit and version a social feed.
2019-07-02T01:33:33Z	@rho: Look over my feed to see how I do mentions. https://wiki.xxiivv.com/twtxt.txt
2019-07-01T03:33:33Z	Implemented mentions, you can now mention someone like this @example.
2019-07-01T02:33:33Z	I thought maybe we could use this place to talk and experiments in the vein of Rotonde, this service is entirely decentralized, feel free to clone this repo and host your own clients. To add new entries, update your twtxt feed with the tool of your choice. Entries can be edited and removed, nothing is hosted on the webring.
2019-07-01T01:13:33Z	Welcome to the Hallway @rho!
2019-07-29T05:24:48Z	/wiki I've built a first version of the decentralized wiki software for our webring. You can add content via an ndtl file and it should automatically display here: https://webring.xxiivv.com/wiki.html I hope we can expand this into a resource site to share our links and related interests! Let me know what you think.
2019-07-30T10:01:12Z	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> have you tried ArchARM? It's pretty stable and usable. Otherwise, I would also go for Raspbian Lite, it's by far the more .. predicatable distro for the Pi.
2019-08-01T01:45:37Z	So many new faces in the Hallway, hello everyone!
2019-08-01T01:47:37Z	/meta External mentions are now prefixed with the caret character. So we know when it references someone outside of the Hallway. We could also decide to not display mentions outside of the hallway entirely. Let me know what you think.
2019-08-01T11:05:46Z	@<stephen https://phse.net/twtxt/merv.txt> I'm glad to hear you find time to do things you love. From your recent messages you seem to be feeling a bit.. lost?
2019-08-02T05:59:27Z	@<ckipp https://chronica.xyz/hallway.txt> Okay, let's do that for now. It will also be more respectful of people's privacy.
2019-08-02T06:00:41Z	@<leo https://www.gkbrk.com/twtxt.txt> Well, it's the first time that we have users doing external mentions so far.
2019-08-02T06:02:02Z	/wiki @<azlen https://azlen.me/twtxt.txt> I don't think you need to give them any special notation, you could choose to collect them into their own category.
2019-08-12T08:29:09Z	/meta Thanks everyone who submitted PRs these past few days, the hallway and wiki are looking better than ever! Sorry I've been silent these past few days, we're soon moving back to Canada and orchestrating this whole thing is taking a toll.
2019-08-16T20:28:44Z	/library I've just spent the whole day reading Girl's Last Tour, I highly recommend it. It has a very Blame-like feel, but also has the reflective aspect of Ergo Proxy, but without all the noise. It's just a super elegant story of two travelers in the ruins of an ancient civilisation, in 6 volumes. 
2019-08-16T20:29:50Z	/meta I love what the wiki is turning into, someone was asking me earlier if there are any other example of something like it, and I couldn't think of any. If anyone has a link, could you send it over?
2019-09-02T08:34:52Z	@<ckipp https://chronica.xyz/hallway.txt> shard is a brilliant idea, hae you thought about incorporating as part of your site in some way? I've been scratching my head lately wondering if there isn't a way I could aggregate messages from twtxt with a specific hashtag and display them as comments on xxiivv.
2020-03-18T11:05:41+09:00	It has been a while since I had a working twtxt setup. It's good to be back! I don't have mentions working just yet.
2020-03-18T11:24:09+09:00	/hallway I've removed a bunch of feeds from the hallway with CORS errors.
2020-03-19T10:38:29+09:00	Hey @<amorris https://feed.amorris.ca/hallway.txt>! Sorry I've been away for so long.

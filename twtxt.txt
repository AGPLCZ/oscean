2019-07-01T23:05:00+02:00   Implemented mentions, you can now mention someone like this @<example http://example.org/twtxt.txt>.
2019-07-01T11:00:00+01:00   I thought maybe we could use this place to talk and experiments in the vein of Rotonde, this service is entirely decentralized, feel free to clone this repo and host your own clients. To add new entries, update your twtxt feed with the tool of your choice. Entries can be edited and removed, nothing is hosted on the webring.

2019-07-03T01:31:11Z   @<rho>: I hadn't seen it but I wish I knew about it. Looking into reminded me of Archmage, it was that kind of text based MMO website in which you get a turn every hour, I spend countless hours on there.
2019-07-03T00:32:15Z   /meta I was thinking maybe I could show 50? It's extremely light, and it is meant to be a channel for slow communication. Let's wait and see, let me know if you think we've exceeded a confortable amount of entries
2019-07-03T00:30:51Z   @<Aaron Morris> Keep me posted, I'm also in a similar situtation. I get where you're coming from, even tho it's totally not efficient controlling hardware synths via livecoding is a lot of fun, I spend my nights recently doing lc on the norns, and controlling my analog synths via midi. You can see some details on the synths I use over at http://wiki.xxiivv.com/studio
2019-07-02T22:11:38Z   /meta Currently implementing better mentions so you can just type the author's name and the client will locate and append the url.
2019-07-02T22:10:12Z   @<Aaron Morris>: That's a hard question, I don't personally find that hardware synths for livecoding is a good match, since you want to have your hands on the keyboard to actually livecode, moving the keyboard to the synth breaks the flow of LC. Therefore I cannot really recommend you one, but maybe the small synth boxes that are fully operable via midi might be fun, see Waldorf.
2019-07-02T22:04:33Z   Hey @<Stephen Lindberg>, welcome to the Hallway!
2019-07-02T07:32:12Z   /meta Starting to implement channels.
2019-07-02T06:49:19Z   @<amorris https://feed.amorris.ca/hallway.txt>: Welcome to the Hallway!
2019-07-02T03:27:21Z   @<drisc https://drisc.io/hallway/twtxt.txt>: For the highlight, you need to use your full name separated by a plus sign, so "#cory+driscoll".
2019-07-02T02:17:57Z   I will grab lunch and finish the #tag implementation! Stay tuned. I hope this inspires people to create their own websites and blogs. @<drisc https://drisc.io/hallway/twtxt.txt> Okay, we will keep full names for now then.
2019-07-02T01:59:33Z   Would you prefer if we used handles instead of full names? I'm thinking it could be fun to implement #tag so we can filter the entries into channels. What do you think?
2019-07-02T01:52:38Z   Welcome to the Hallway @<drisc https://drisc.io/hallway/twtxt.txt>! Glad you resolved your CORS issues.
2019-07-02T01:51:46Z   Added a ~iso command to XXIIVV, so I can get the current time quickly, maybe I should make myself a tool to add entries into the twtxt file.
2019-07-02T01:49:38Z   Fixed issue with timezones, entries should now display properly. I feel like there will be a lot of CORS errors, I should catch these. I love to finally have the ability to edit and version a social feed.
2019-07-02T01:33:33Z   @<rho https://electro.pizza/twtxt.txt>: Look over my feed to see how I do mentions. https://wiki.xxiivv.com/twtxt.txt
2019-07-01T03:33:33Z   Implemented mentions, you can now mention someone like this @<example http://example.org/twtxt.txt>.
2019-07-01T02:33:33Z   I thought maybe we could use this place to talk and experiments in the vein of Rotonde, this service is entirely decentralized, feel free to clone this repo and host your own clients. To add new entries, update your twtxt feed with the tool of your choice. Entries can be edited and removed, nothing is hosted on the webring.

  bref : This wiki is a digital playground and personal logging system.
  body : <p>The aim of this wiki is to build a form of <b>personal assistant</b> to help with the management of a vast repository of recorded statistics which includes <a href='tracker.html'>daily logs</a>, notes on <a href='journal.html'>various projects</a> and <a href='mirrors.html'>curated pages of general knowledge</a>.</p><p><a href='oscean.html'>oscean</a> is written in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99' class='external' target='_blank'>C99</a>, and designed to operate on <a href='hardware.html'>low-power devices</a>. It is built to adapt to my needs as they change, and to <a href='longtermism.html'>technology as it evolves</a>.</p><p>Each part of this project should aim to persist across <a href='longtermism.html'>Technological Long Term</a>, not one part of it should rely on heavy dependencies. — Every function should be <b>specific</b>, <b>unobfuscated</b>, and each one carefully chosen against general-purpose libraries, frameworks or wasteful foreign entities.</p><p>Using this tool should be <b>frictionless and undisruptive</b>, its formats and subsequent products versionable, re-purposable, interpretable and text-editable. Only through <b>open sources, open standards, human-readable formats</b> and their independencies, might they survive this fleeting age of self-destructing informatics.</p><p>These attributes should not only be <b>perceptible in its design</b>, <br />but deeply <b>rooted in its code</b>.</p><p>This type of website is a often referred to as a "memex", a kind of archive and mirror of everything that one has done, that one has learnt. It's a living document that outlines where one has been, and a tool that advises where one could go.</p><q>Consider a future device, a sort of mechanized private library in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.</q><h5>—Vannevar Bush, As We May Think</h5><h3>License</h3><p>The license applies to all the <b>documented projects, the projects themselves and their assets</b>.

There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby.</p><p>Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.</p><p>To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black and white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.</p><p>To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent's shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon's bullets.</p>

  body : <p>I have aligned my life toward a singular design, the <b>acceleration of Arts & Science</b>.</p><p>The analysis of <a href='horaire.html'>personal statistics</a> recorded through <a href='routine.html'>daily journaling</a>, revealed that <a href='travel.html'>travel</a> converts into the most <a href='horaire.html'>hours of inspiration</a>. From this insight, I have oriented my creative work toward facilitating opportunities to travel.</p><p>Multi-tasking revealed itself to have a negative impact on my productivity. Working within the confines of a single medium, would convert into long periods of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place over a period of a year showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school, learning to play music, moving abroad — showed an improvement in the realization of <i>Arts & Sciences</i>.</p><p>Automating work always converted to higher long-term output than attempts at brute force. Building specific <a href='tools.html'>tools</a> mostly returned higher performance than <a href='about.html'>learning general purpose tools</a>.</p><q>Optimizing toward the <b>need for less revenue</b> has yielded better results than optimizing toward the generation of more.</q><p>Remaining immobile in moments of doubts and planning, always converted into better output, against acting impulsively and making possible accidental steps away from the acceleration of <i>Arts & Sciences</i>.</p><p>I have kept <a href='journal.html'>journals</a> recording the oscillation of <b>Efficiency</b> and <b>Effectiveness</b>, and used this data to optimize and navigate my own personal tempers of productivity. Based on previously recorded patterns, I assign to myself each day a single task to complete. The task is chosen specifically to utilize the optimal amount of available stamina.</p><p>When a workday ends before the daily task is completed, the day was a planning failure; and the task is broken down into smaller tasks, each assigned to one day. When a task is completed too early, the day is also a planning failure.</p><p>I do not get out of bed until I have chosen a task to complete & and a lesson to learn, and I do not go to sleep until I have <a href='routine.html'>logged the results</a>. The tasks are selected in the following order: I first address the problems that slow me down, the things I find lacking in my life and the answers to questions that occupies my mind.</p>

  bref : The Nomad diaries.
  body : <p>My first encounter with a <i>sailing nomad</i> was during my stay in <a href='czech.html'>Prague</a>. There was a time when I may have felt homesick, but for now, <i>Home</i> was becoming an increasingly vague concept shedding the little meaning it might have once held.</p><p>The monthly rent of our beach-side appartment in <a href='tokyo.html'>tokyo</a> was of about 1.75K$, and transitioning from it, to a sailboat, implicated some serious downsizing. The way we looked at it was that, within 3 years, our 20K$ sailboat would be paid at the rate of 600$ per month — Or that by halving the costs of our current living situation, we could become both "homeowners" while keeping our traveling options open.</p><p>To think that, at the time, the harder things to let go of were instruments, old consoles, books and some camera equipment — When the truly hard things to let go of would be the habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet connection. </p><p>But surely I did not do all this travel for the travel alone, I must have had passions, habits and goals before I left — Everything that used to define me is beginning to feel increasingly like distractions, simulations to protect me from truly experiencing anything. I had never let myself feel cold, I had never let myself feel hungry.</p><p>The wind rocks the ship sideways, keeping me up at night, but all I can feel is that humbling sense of being present and part of nature. I have long forgotten about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, I began to wonder why people even feel the need to take showers every day, and time away from social networks really does make me feel better.</p><q>I traded the things I thought I cared about, for things I didn't know existed.</q><p>Eventually, I got back to building things, I learned how to fix sails, repair a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine — Even to live without power.</p><p>We have seen every sunset and almost every sunrise, we have sailed with dolphins, we have climbed mountains on deserted islands, and we have met the most amazing people. When it is our time to go, we will have no regrets, for we were fortunate to have seen more than most.</p>

  bref : Notes on Routine and Habits.
  body : <p>A <b>typical day</b> usually begins at around 6:00am.</p><p>I tend to try and <b>keep my eyes shut</b> until I have mentally drafted a <a href='aesthetics.html'>rough plan</a> of the things I will want to have done by the end of that day. I rise to grind coffee — I usually ever <b>only drink one cup</b> per day.</p><p>I immediately set off to complete the task I planned in bed. I know to have about 3 hours of undisturbed flow before the distraction surrounding lunch-time pulls me away from the work. My goal for each day, is to complete <b>a single task</b> that should take about 3 hours to complete — Or between <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique' class='external' target='_blank'>4 to 5 pomodoros</a>.</p><p>After the last pomodoro, I usually <b>cook for a half-hour</b>, and then <b>eat for a half-hour</b>, and then <b>walk for a half-hour</b>, to fully leave the haze of the <i>flowstate</i>. The afternoon is spent doing maintenance, superficial work and experiments. But mostly, the afternoon is spent reading and learning. The goal is to build a catalog of exciting things to wake up to the next day and to experiment with.</p><p>The superficial work that I do involves replying to blogs & forums, editing wikipedia entries, doing maintenance to various repositories, answering emails and so on..</p><p>The day ends with <b>journaling for a half-hour</b> at which point I record the task done, and the <a href='mirrors.html'>lessons learned</a>. Before sleeping, I usually <b>read for a half-hour</b>, I go to bed with a <a href='readings.html'>book</a>, and a highlighter pen. I overline the things I want to keep for a later use, or to revisit.</p>

longtermism
  unde : lifestyle
  bref : Notes on Longtermism and sustainability.
  body : <p>In an age of disposable smart devices and unrepairable electronics, there are few topics that occupy my mind as much as <b>solutioning for technological resilience</b>.</p><p><a href='pino.html'>Living aboard a sailboat</a>, away from reliable internet connectivity and outside of delivery networks, encourages us at <a href='hundred_rabbits.html'>Hundred Rabbits</a>, to consider ways with which we can strenghten the toolset onto which we rely, to reflect on novel ways to simplify the systems that we use, and to optimize toward more environmentally conscious practices.</p><p>We must abandon 3-in-1 packages, bloated always-online services and general planned obsolesce, and establish practices of recyclism, minimum viable products, small-sharp modular utilities. We see smart and resilience as opposing attributes to a device, smart is inherently contrary to a single purpose tool, and thus incompatible with longtermism.</p><p>Our focus over the past years has gradually shifted toward open-source software and modular(combinable) electronics. Looking back, we are proud of the open-source tools that we created, enabling a handful of people to exit subscription services, and inscrutable closed-source utilities. Moving forward, we are thinking more and more about hardware, or at least software that resides closer to the metal.</p><p>I periodically find myself thinking about operating systems, or more specifically the interaction design of OSes. In attempting to tackle the difficult UX challenges of that space, unrealizing that my failure to solve these issues might very well come from the simple fact that the purpose of operating systems is to enable multi-tasking, multi-tasking that I try to eradicate from my daily life, making these issues deeply unsolvable and my love for sharp tools and OSes irreconcilable.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if we shouldn't re-orient our focus onto things that can run on small low-power open-source single-purpose boards, but I also consider the impact of pushing for the purchase and production more electronics as problematic; perhaps creating software targeting old hardware might be what I'm looking for.</p><p>Despite all this, I dream of a line of simple electronics, each one designed for a single purpose. Or even for things beyond the realm of electronics, like a kit bicyle with all its superfluousities removed.</p><p>My dream sailboat has no diesel engine, no fuel outboard and no lead acid battery storage, but instead a compressed air engine with its compression stored in diving tanks, a bike crank powered compressor, a hydro generator pump, and a dynamo to charge our low-power electronics. The only crucial electronic systems connected to the house tanks would be the AIS transceiver, the VHF radio, a basic chartplotter and habitat lighting. Our work and entertainment electronics, like our laptops and cameras, would run off solar charging a minimal array of LiPo batteries.</p><p>Is there a way to create and distribute software and electronics in a way that is environmentally conscious? perhaps <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth' class='external' target='_blank'>not</a>.</p>

  body : <p>The function of proteins is to be used for tissue growth and repair, but when carbohydrates and calories are lacking, proteins can be consumed for fuel.</p><p>The human body's own proteins are constantly being broken down into <b>amino acids</b> and used throughout its systems.</p><p>The human body is mostly made of proteins, and proteins are made of amino acids - permutations of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sometimes sulphur. There are 22 amino acids in total and all but 9 can be synthesized, the <b>Essential Amino Acids</b>.</p><p>To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs have access to the full sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is missing, the unusable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or sugars.</p><p>Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a complete protein(see <i>Limiting Amino Acids</i>) are oats, garbanzo beans, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice, peanuts and pumpkin seeds.</p><q>There are a few things in life that are as transformative and transhumanistic as <a href='nutrition.html'>nutrition</a></q><p>There are also high-quality proteins in green beans, swiss chard, broccoli, mustard greens, asparagus and potatoes but in lesser quantity.</p><p>Soy products have within them 100% of a complete protein, or the correct ratio of essential amino acids for the body to use in tissue growth and repair.</p><p>The high-quality protein foods can be made whole by combining with other ingredients, but the basic optimal combinations is <b>Beans with grains, nuts or seeds</b>.</p><q>The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will instruct his patient in the care of the human frame in diet and in the cause and prevention of diseases.</q><h5>—Thomas Edison, 1903</h5>

  bref : 
  body : <h4>What inspired you to play music?</h4><p>I knew that I should want to write my own music when I was at a chiptune concert, I realized at that moment that I could write music with non-traditional and custom-made instruments.</p><h4>When were you first introduced to chiptune music?</h4><p>At the Gamma Festival in Montreal, Bubblyfish was the first performing chiptune act that I ever saw.</p><h4>What kind of music do you play and why?</h4><p>I tend to navigate the space between ambient and industrial music, I write starkly contrasted rhythmic music as I find it best to describe the environments explored in the songs.</p><h4>What themes are you trying to uncover in your music?</h4><p>Most of the music I write as <a href='aliceffekt.html'>aliceffekt</a> is about a character's travels across the frigid scapes of this fictional world called the <a href='neauismetica.html'>neauismetica</a>, on this foreign planet called <a href='dinaisth.html'>dinaisth</a>.</p><h4>Why did you decide to accompany your music with visuals?</h4><p>The visuals came first, and I wrote the music to accompany the drawings. So the music merely accompany the visuals.</p><h4>Do you have a set of tracks you play regularly?</h4><p>I tend to write music for specific events that occur in the Neauismetica, and when I perform live, I pick moments which best fit with the other performers.</p><h4>What is your approach when you perform live?</h4><p>It depends, sometimes it's improvisational, like the <a href='telekinetic.html'>telekinetic</a> show. Or sometimes it's procedural, like the <a href='ehrivevnv_studies.html'>ehrivevnv_studies</a>, where I merely make sure that everything is tuned properly. Sometimes I mix old songs and focus on building interesting visuals if the venue allows for it. As of late, I have been livecoding, where the song writing is done as a performance.</p><h4>How do you approach songwriting?</h4><p>I tend to write the song in my head entirely, and put it down in one setting. I often write music about the Neauismetica, it's a kind of mental place, a pool of endless musical idea I can visit and explore, it's where most of the songs come from.</p><h4>When performing live, what's your setup like?</h4><p>It varies, I've written a couple of shows to be performed with a specific synth, or a specific hardware like with the LeapMotion. Typically, I just use a combination of midi controllers and livecoding.</p><h4>What instruments do you play?</h4><p>None. I'm not interested in the tactile aspect of music rendition, my love is for composition and synthesis.</p><h4>Where does the name Aliceffekt comes from?</h4><p>Alice Effekt was a <a href='https://youtu.be/VSKXfDMpqns?t=51m8s' class='external' target='_blank'>track by Drome</a> that I liked a lot when I started writing music. My goal was to write music just like it. But it has since evolved into something else.</p>

  body : <h4>Which creative discipline did you begin with, and how did you shift to other mediums?</h4><p>At first, I stumbled onto photo manipulation. From DeviantArt, to Raster and to <a href='http://www.depthcore.com' class='external' target='_blank'>Depthcore</a>, I was moving from working with photos, to drawing, and eventually modeling. While I enjoyed visual arts, I felt that to keep sharpening the rendition of the worlds I was drawing, I needed to add a new dimension and so I began writing soundtracks to the pictures, and eventually putting all of it together in the form of websites, and games.</p><h4>What is the meaning of the glyph in your avatar?</h4><p>It is an old rendition of the character for blue, found in the the Shuowen Jiezi, the character dictionary written by Xu Shen, 100 CE. This particular glyph has probably never been used outside of paleography. I found it to be very beautiful, and the word "blue" has a special meaning in the stories from which my handle "neauoire" comes from.</p><h4>What is the significance of your neck tattoo?</h4><p>My tattoo is three dots in the shape of a triangle, or at an equal distance from each other, it signifies audio, visual and research. I call this arrangement "trisight", it's a reminder that, being a generalist, I must constantly pull from these 3 mediums in order to create complete works.</p><h4>Where does your name come from?</h4><p>I began using the name online around 2005, Devine Lu Linvega comes from Davine Lu Linvega of the series <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame!' class='external' target='_blank'>Blame</a>, by Tsutomu Nihei, which was very influential to me at the time.</p><h4>Why did you choose that name?</h4><p>I had been looking for a name that did <b>not</b> represent who I was, but instead who I would like to become. I wanted something that would serve as a reminder to put curiousity above power, that did not lock myself in the past, but would force me forward toward that ideal.</p><h4>Who is Davine Lu Linvega in the book?</h4><p>She was unique from other antagonists in that she doesn't seem to desire killing humans, instead, she devotes her time and energy into finding a way to access an hyper-evolved version of the Internet in the universe of BLAME. As seen in her dying words, Davine was not motivated by a pursuit for power, but rather wanted to see the Netsphere out of pure curiosity.</p>

  body : <h4>What are the most important concepts that you impart in your works?</h4><p>A lot of my work deal with foreignness and adaptiveness, some of the most romantic ideas that one will find in my work is that of explorers wandering the remains of a long extinguished civilisation, and trying to make sense of it.</p><h4>Why do you release free software?</h4><p>Being away from accessible internet connectivity, the most practical mean for us to develop and release projects is via <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar' class='external' target='_blank'>the bazaar model</a>, where the code is often maintained by others while we are away, and so as to not capitalize unfairly on all the help that we receive, we decided to only accept donations.</p><h4>Why do you release open-source software?</h4><p>Being incapable of sitting through a class back in high-school, most of the learning that I was able to do was from looking at other people's sources and trying to make sense of the way they think and understand the reasons for solutioning in that particular way. For an ecosystem of tools to be truly resilient, individuals must be able to repair, maintain and inspect the software that they use.</p><h4>Why is journaling important to you?</h4><p>I keep records of everything I make, and everything I consume. The idea is to better understand my creative patterns, and to predict changes in mood and interest. Ultimately, the goal is to plan more efficiently, to spend my time with more efficacy and to work less.</p>

Everyone should build a small network, a place where they can feel comfortable to experiment, show works-in-progress and exchange on the topics of art and science in a safe place among like-minded people.</p><h4>Why do you think people should travel more?</h4><p>I found <a href='travel.html'>travel</a> to be a good catalyst toward learning <a href='language.html'>new languages</a>, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity and creativity.</p><h4>How do you draw the line between what is published, and what stays private?</h4><p>Working <a href='identity.html'>behind an avatar</a> and living online through a proxy name offers a good healthy distance between the work and the self. The Devine Lu Linvega project focuses on making explicit the reflections, and techniques for the creative process. My intimate life, my health, my friends and family are outside of the scope of this project.</p>

the sartre mechanism
  unde : notebook
  bref : The The Sartre Mechanism short.
  body : <p>It was the first day of the winter when a friend invited me to witness the completion of a recent project.</p><p>Crouched over a heap of cogs, she did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine. A distracted gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the busy studio.</p><p>What I first perceived as a pile of junk turned out to be an intricate clocklike mechanism; where the needles would have been, a small hand rested at the end of a short metallic arm.</p><p>My friend held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto its opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged and plucked a gear out from its own ticking body and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core exposed.</p><p>I stared in silent awe, at the busy mechanical concerto playing its own requiem. The arms eventually began to unbuilding the core, growing forever weakly as it dismantled the remaining components, moving them back into the box. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and exposé on pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had fallen back into the toolbox.</p><p>Written by <a href='https://twitter.com/voidshaper' class='external' target='_blank'>Voidshaper</a> & <a href='devine lu linvega.html'>Neauoire</a>.</p>

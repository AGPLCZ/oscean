<p>For most basic operations including mathematical computations, HyperTalk favored natural-language ordering of predicates over the ordering used in mathematical notation. For example, in HyperTalk's put assignment command, the variable was placed at the end of the statement:</p>

<pre>put 5 * 4 into theResult</pre>

<h3>Go</h3>

<p>The go command can be used in two ways. It can allow the user to go to any card in the stack that it is  in or to any card of any other stack that is available.</p>

<pre>go to card id 3807</pre>

<h3>Put/Set</h3>

<p>To change the text value, or textstyle of a field:</p>

<pre>
on mouseUp
  put random(100) into card field "target"
  set the textstyle of card field "Title" to italic
end mouseUp
</pre>

<h3>Show/Hide</h3>

<p>The hide command can be used to hide any object. Some examples are: buttons, fields, and the menubar. The opposite of the hide command is  the show command, and it can be used to make an object show up again. </p>

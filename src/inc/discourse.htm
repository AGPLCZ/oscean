<h3>Argument Ranking</h3>
<table border='1'>
  <tr><td>●●●●●</td><td>High-level generators</td><td>Disagreements that remain when everyone understands exactly what's being argued, and agrees on what all the evidence says, but have vague and hard-to-define reasons for disagreeing.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●●○</td><td>Operationalizing</td><td>Where both parties understand they're in a cooperative effort to fix exactly what they're arguing about.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●○○</td><td>Survey of evidence</td><td>Not trying to devastate the other person with a mountain of facts and start looking at the studies and arguments on both sides and figuring out what kind of complex picture they paint.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●○○</td><td>Disputing definitions</td><td>Argument hinges on the meaning of words, or whether something counts as a member of a category or not.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●○○○</td><td>Single Studies</td><td>Better than scattered facts, proving they at least looked into the issue formally.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●○○○</td><td>Demands for rigor</td><td>Attempts to demand that an opposing argument be held to such strict standards that nothing could possibly clear the bar.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●○○○○</td><td>Single Facts</td><td>One fact, which admittedly does support their argument, but presented as if it solves the debate in and of itself.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●○○○○</td><td>Gotchas</td><td>Short claims that purport to be devastating proof that one side can't possibly be right.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>○○○○○</td><td>Social shaming</td><td>A demand for listeners to place someone outside the boundary of whom deserve to be heard.</td></tr>

  <tr><td>●●●●○○</td><td>Counterargument</td><td>Contradict with added reasoning or evidence.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>●●●○○○</td><td>Contradiction</td><td>State the opposing case, what.</td></tr>

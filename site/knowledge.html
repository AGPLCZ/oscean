When we are able to despise in practice all that is unnecessary to life, when we will disdain luxury and comfort, when we will savor the physical pleasure that come from simple food and drink — when our bodies as well as our souls will know the goodness of bread and water we will be able to advance further along the road.</p><p>The wise man notes that material progress has as its object the increasing of the artificial needs of some and the labor of others. Material progress appears to him as an increasing weight, which increasingly plunges man in the mud and in suffering.</p><q>A man is wealthy in proportion to the things he can do without.</q><h5>—Epicurus</h5><p><i>incoming(1)</i>: <a href='mirrors.html'>mirrors</a> </p><p><i>Last update on <a href='tracker.html'>18V12</a>, edited 3 times. +5/9fh</i><code style='float:right; font-size:80%'>----+-</code></p></main><footer><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/'><img src='../media/icon/rotonde.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://github.com/neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github' width='30'/></a><span><a href='devine_lu_linvega.html'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> © 2020 — <a href='about.html'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>

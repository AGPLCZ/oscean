We see smart and resilience as opposing attributes to a device, smart is inherantly contrary to a single purpose tool, and thus incompatible with longtermism.</p><p>Our focus over the past year has gradually shifted toward open-source software and modular(combinable) electronics. Looking back, we are proud of the open-source tools that we created, enabling a handful of people to exit subscription services, and inscrutable closed-source utilities. Moving forward, we are thinking more and more about hardware, or at least software that resides closer to the metal.</p><p>I periodically find myself thinking about operating systems, or more specifically the interaction design of OSes. I attempting to tackle the difficult UX challenges of that space, unrealizing that my failure to solve these issues might very well come from the simple fact that the purpose of operating systems is to enable multi-tasking, multi-tasking that I try to erradicate from my daily life, making these these issues deeply unsolvable and my love for sharp tools and OSes ireconcilable.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if we shouldn't re-orient our focus onto things that can run on small low-power open-source single-purpose boards, but I also consider the impact of pushing for the purchase and production more electronics as problematic; perhaps creating software targetting old hardware might be what I'm looking for.</p><p>Despite all this, I dream of a line of simple electronics, each one designed for a single purpose. Or even for things beyond the realm of electronics, like a kit bicyle with all its superfluousities removed.</p><p>My dream sailboat has no diesel engine, no fuel outboard and no lead acid battery storage, but instead a compressed air engine with its compression stored in diving tanks, a bike crank powered compressor, a hydro generator pump, and a dynamo to charge our low-power electronics. The only crutial electronic systems connected to the house tanks would be the AIS transceiver, the VHF radio, a basic chartplotter and habitat lighting. Our work and entertainment electronics, like our laptops and cameras, would run off solar charging a minimal array of LiPo batteries.</p><p>Is there a way to create and distribute software and electronics in a way that is environmentally conscious? perhaps <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth' class='external' target='_blank'>not</a>.</p><ul></ul><p><i>Last update on <a href='https://github.com/xxiivv/oscean' target='_blank' class='external'>19S14</a>.</i></p><ul></ul></main><footer><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0' target='_blank'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg' alt='by-nc-sa' width='30'/></a> <a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'><img src='../media/icon/rotonde.svg' alt='webring' width='30'/></a> <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire' target='_blank'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg' alt='Merveilles' width='30'/></a> <a href='https://github.com/neauoire' target='_blank'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github' width='30'/></a> <span><a href='devine_lu_linvega.html' target='_self'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> © 2020 — <a href='about.html' target='_self'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>

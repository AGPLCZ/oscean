I have then steered my creative work toward facilitating opportunities to travel.</p><p>Multi-tasking revealed itself to have a negative impact on my productivity. Working within the confines of a single medium, would convert into long periods of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place over a period of a year showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school, learning to play music, moving abroad — showed an improvement in the realization of <i >Arts & Sciences</i>.</p><p>Automating work always converted to higher long-term output than attempts at brute force. Building specific <a href='tools.html'>tools</a> mostly returned higher performance than <a href='about.html'>learning general purpose tools</a>.</p><q>Optimizing toward the <b>need for less revenue</b> has yielded better results than optimizing toward the generation of more.</q><h5>— DLL</h5><p>Remaining immobile in moments of doubts and planning, always converted into better output, against acting impulsively and making possible accidental steps away from the acceleration of <i >Arts & Sciences</i>.</p><p>I have kept <a href='journal.html'>journals</a> recording oscillation in flux of <b>Efficiency</b> and <b>Effectiveness</b>, and used this data to optimize and steer moods of productivity. Each day has a singular task assigned, connected to a specific medium, suggested from previous optimal patterns of productivity.</p><p>When a day ends before its task was completed, the day was a planning failure; and the task is broken down into smaller tasks, each assigned to one day. When the task is completed before mid-day, the day is also a planning failure.</p><p>I do not get out of bed until I have chosen a <i >task to complete</i> & and a <i >lesson to learn</i>, and I do not go to sleep until I have logged the results. The tasks are selected in the following order: I first address the problems that slow me down, the things I find lacking in life and the answers to questions that occupy the idle mind.</p><h3><a href='nomad.html'>nomad</a></h3><p>My first encounter with a Nomad was during my stay in <a href='czech.html'>Prague</a>, as <i >Santiago</i>, I had just met my <b>Fulcanelli</b>.</p><p>There was a time in my life when I may have felt homesick. But for now, Home was but a vague concept that existed out there, <i >forever fleeting</i>.</p><p>An office is no place a multi-disciplinarist, and <a href='japan.html'>japan</a> was where I last fought this loosing battle. My desk, not the medium onto which I would acquire the skills I longed for.</p><p>The suffocating curiousity of wanting to know how different my life might be, had gotten worse than the daily frictions of my current situation. The decision of living aboard a <a href='pino.html'>float home</a> was not picked amongst other equally enticing ideas, for it was, at the time, the only solution that would align with what I wanted in life.</p><p>The monthly rent of our beachside Tokyo appartment was of about 1.5K$, and transitioning from it, to a sailboat, implicated some serious downsizing. The way we looked at it was that, within 3 years, our 20K$ sailboat would be paid at the rate of 600$ per month — Or that by cutting the costs of our current living situation in half, we could be both "home owners" and keep our traveling options open.</p><q>Will you trade the proximity to friends and family in exchange for your independence?</q><h5>— DLL</h5><p>To think that, at the time, the most heart-breaking things to let go of were instruments, old consoles, books and some camera equipment — When the truly hard things to let go of would be the habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet connection.</p><p>Everything costs more than expected, takes longer than expected and Amazon doesn't deliver to your <a href='marquesas.html'>desert island</a>. Surely you did not do all this travel for the travel alone, you had passions, habits and goals when you left.</p><p>The wind rocks the habitat sideways, keeping you up at night. But at least, you get to spend your day writing. You forget about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, you wonder why people take showers every day, and time away from social networks really does make you feel better.</p><q>Being nomad is trading the things you think you care about, for things you didn't know existed.</q><h5>— DLL</h5><p>Suddenly, it's business as usual. You get back to building things, only now, when you look outside, the upmost gorgeous sunset precedes the darkest of night.</p><p>You learnt how to fix sails, repair a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine — Even to live without a fridge and power.</p><p>We have seen every sunset and almost every sunrise, we have sailed with dolphins, we have climbed mountains on desert islands, and we have met the most amazing people.</p><h3><a href='nutrition.html'>nutrition</a></h3><p>The function of proteins is to be used for tissue growth and repair, but when carbohydrates and calories are lacking, proteins can be consumed for fuel.</p><p>The human body's own proteins are constantly being broken down into <b>amino acids</b> and used throughout its systems.</p><p>The human body is mostly made of proteins, and proteins are made of amino acids - permutations of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sometimes sulphur. There are 22 amino acids in total and all but 9 can be synthesized, the <b>Essential Amino Acids</b>.</p><p>To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs have access to the full sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is missing, the unusable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or sugars.</p><p>Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a complete protein(see <i >Limiting Amino Acids</i>) are oats, garbanzo beans, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice, peanuts and pumpkin seeds.</p><q>There are a few things in life that are as transformative and transhumanistic as <a href='nutrition.html'>nutrition</a>.</q><h5>— DLL</h5><p>There are also high-quality proteins in green beans, swiss chard, broccoli, mustard greens, asparagus and potatoes but in lesser quantity.</p><p>Soy products have within them 100% of a complete protein, or the correct ratio of essential amino acids for the body to use in tissue growth and repair.</p><p>The high-quality protein foods can be made whole by combining with other ingredients, but the basic optimal combinations is <b>Beans with grains, nuts or seeds</b>.</p><q>The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will instruct his patient in the care of the human frame in diet and in the cause and prevention of diseases.</q><h5>— Thomas Edison, 1903</h5><h3><a href='routine.html'>routine</a></h3><p>A <b>typical day</b> usually begins at around 6:00am.</p><p>I tend to try and <b>keep my eyes shut</b> until I have mentally drafted a <a href='aesthetics.html'>rough plan</a> of the things I will want to have done by the end of that day. I then rise to grind coffee — I usually ever <b>only drink one cup</b> per day.</p><p>Before even email or chat, I immediately set off to complete the task I have planned eye-closedly. I know to have about 3 hours of undisturbed flow before the distraction surrounding lunch-time pulls me away from the work. My daily goal is to complete, <b>at least, single task a day</b>, the daily task is devised in a way that it should take about 3 hours to complete — Or between <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique' class='external' target='_blank'>4 to 5 pomodoros</a>.</p><p>After the last pomodoro, I tend to cook. I try as much as possible to take a full hour for lunch, to try and exit the state of flow. The afternoon is spent doing maintenance or superficial work, experiments. But mostly, the afternoon is spent reading and learning. The goal is to build a catalog of exciting things to wake up to the next day and to experiment with.</p><p>The superficial work that I do involves replies to blogs, maintenance to the repositories that I collaborate on, edits to various wikipedia entries, answering emails and so on..</p><p>The day ends with <a href='journal.html'>journaling</a> at which point I record the task done, and if any, the <a href='mirrors.html'>lessons learnt</a>. I usually go to sleep with a <a href='directory.html'>book</a>, and a highlighter pen. I overline the things I want to keep for a later use, or to revisit.</p><h3><a href='longtermism.html'>longtermism</a></h3><p>In an age of disposable smart devices and unrepairable electronics, there are few topics that occupy my mind as much as <b>solutioning for technological resilience</b>.</p><p><a href='pino.html'>Living aboard a sailboat</a>, away from reliable internet connectivity and outside of delivery networks, encourages us at <a href='hundred_rabbits.html'>Hundred Rabbits</a>, to consider ways with which we can strenghten the toolset onto which we rely, to reflect on novel ways to simplify the systems that we use, and to optimize toward more <a href='solarpunk.html'>environmentally councious</a> practices.</p><p>We must abandon 3-in-1 packages, bloated always-online services and general planned obsolesce, and establish practices of recyclism, minimum viable products, small-sharp modular utilities. We see smart and resilience as opposing attributes to a device, smart is inherantly contrary to a single purpose tool, and thus incompatible with longtermism.</p><p>Our focus over the past year has gradually shifted toward open-source software and modular(combinable) electronics. Looking back, we are proud of the open-source tools that we created, enabling a handful of people to exit subscription services, and inscrutable closed-source utilities. Moving forward, we are thinking more and more about hardware, or at least software that resides closer to the metal.</p><p>I periodically find myself thinking about operating systems, or more specifically the interaction design of OSes. I attempting to tackle the difficult UX challenges of that space, unrealizing that my failure to solve these issues might very well come from the simple fact that the purpose of operating systems is to enable multi-tasking, multi-tasking that I try to erradicate from my daily life, making these these issues deeply unsolvable and my love for sharp tools and OSes ireconcilable.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if we shouldn't re-orient our focus onto things that can run on small low-power open-source single-purpose boards, but I also consider the impact of pushing for the purchase and production more electronics as problematic; perhaps creating software targetting old hardware might be what I'm looking for.</p><p>Despite all this, I dream of a line of simple electronics, each one designed for a single purpose. Or even for things beyond the realm of electronics, like a kit bicyle with all its superfluousities removed.</p><p>My dream sailboat has no diesel engine, no fuel outboard and no lead acid battery storage, but instead a compressed air engine with its compression stored in diving tanks, a bike crank powered compressor, a hydro generator pump, and a dynamo to charge our low-power electronics. The only crutial electronic systems connected to the house tanks would be the AIS transceiver, the VHF radio, a basic chartplotter and habitat lighting. Our work and entertainment electronics, like our laptops and cameras, would run off solar charging a minimal array of LiPo batteries.</p><p>Is there a way to create and distribute software and electronics in a way that is environmentally conscious? perhaps <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth' class='external' target='_blank'>not</a>.</p><ul></ul><p><i>Last update on <a href='https://github.com/xxiivv/oscean' target='_blank' class='external'>19D10</a>, 2 logs.</i></p><ul></ul></main><footer><hr/><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0' target='_blank'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg' alt='by-nc-sa' width='30'/></a> <a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/#random' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'><img src='../media/icon/rotonde.svg' alt='webring' width='30'/></a> <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire' target='_blank'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg' alt='Merveilles' width='30'/></a> <a href='https://github.com/neauoire' target='_blank'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github' width='30'/></a> <span><a class='profile' href='devine_lu_linvega.html' target='_self'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> © 2020 — <a class='about' href='about.html' target='_self'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>

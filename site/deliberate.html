Even the authors of our sailing manuals cannot explain what might compel anyone to proceed, even once made aware of the perils involved in going forth into the untammed environment that is the high sea, toward a situation with an actual risk of not being able to make it back to shore, and furthermore, for no obvious rewards.</p><p>It seems unjustifyable, or at least masochistic, that a person would wilfully put themself through potential misadventures for fame and curiosity alone, I'm inclinded to believe that certainly mountain climbers might echo these feelings although I don't know any mountain climber with whom I can verify this. And so, perhaps it might in the name of freedom, freedom to practicize direct experience(with all that entails as disconfort, pain, hunger and so on), here we shall name this calling using Thoreau's words <i>to live deliberately</i>.</p><h3>Living by proxies</h3><p>Smart devices to take away the pain of thinking deep thoughts, social things against the solitude, forever removing ourselves, in the guise of protectedness, for a complete thoughtlessness socialized inexistence.</p><p>A creeping feeling of numbness might have accounted for our own grasping this direct experience through long distance sailing, to let ourselves feel cold so we could sense the subtler changes in the weather, to let ourselves go hungry to appreciate simplier foods.</p><p>Similarly, to another extent, one might begin to talk instead of watching talk-shows and to play instead of watching game shows — To value the entire spectrum of sensations as necessary members of the whole that is the deliberate existence, with its potential for failure, awkwardness, loneliness, harm and death included.</p><h3>To feel secure</h3><p>Convenient products will protect those living at odds with nature and the individual. Novel and fashionable horrors will be popularized to subvert anyone into docility, else new fears will be provided as obedience demands.</p><p>In the name of security, a modern citizen will be thoroughly handled. A modern civilisation will deem itself total as it finally does away with all inconveniences, vanquished the totality of the Unknowable, the Indifferent, the Unorganizeable, of nature, by means of paving over it. </p><p>I have seen the non-participation to the throughput mechanisms of society labeled as escapism, but I look at it in reverse where one escape by secluding one's own presence from nature. An illusory sense of dominion and domestication of nature might make one think of it as a place where one can escape to, and this surely is re-enforced when seen through the lense of a plastic protective layer of proxies and simulations, but the wrapping curves not outward upon nature, but the inward upon and over the individual. And that is itself absolute escapism.</p><p>I'm inclinded to believe that one can use nature's indifference as a reminder of the actual fortitude of their being, to learn of own's true capacity for resilience when communing with nature — Ideas altogether at odds with modern stories, or an invitation to be part of something.</p></main><footer><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg'/></a><a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/'><img src='../media/icon/rotonde.svg'/></a><a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg'/></a><a href='https://github.com/neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github'/></a><span><a href='devine_lu_linvega.html'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> © 2020 — <a href='about.html'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>
